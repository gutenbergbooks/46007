</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='chI.' class='c002'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />THE SIGN OF THE THUMB.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Well, my young skyscrapers, I hear that you
were lost in Petrograd, but the special messengers
tell me that if anything else was lost it was not time
on the way back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviation chief in Warsaw had this greeting
for Our Young Aeroplane Scouts, Billy Barry, U.
S. A., and his chum Henri Trouville, when the
young airmen completed an interview with Colonel
Malinkoff, the officer who had selected them as pilots
for the dispatch-bearing aerial trip to the Russian
capital.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe you think we are like bad pennies—always
sure to turn up,” laughed Billy. “But, believe
me,” continued the boy, “it was no merry jest to us
when the strange streets seemed to have no end, and
we knew that we were counted upon to pull out by
daylight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t figure, upon my life, why you tried to
foot it alone; at night, too, in a city like that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviation chief had another think coming to
him, if he imagined for a minute that he was going
to hear the real story of the Petrograd adventure
from the youths he addressed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We thought the walk would do us good.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri had some difficulty in keeping a serious
face when Billy offered this plea as an excuse for
the performance that had almost brought nervous
prostration to Salisky and Marovitch, the dispatch
bearers.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a quiet corner later on, Henri had no desire to
even smile when Billy gravely reviewed the possibility
of the vengeful Cossack tracing them to
Warsaw.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know,” said the boy from Bangor, “those
fellows hang on like grim death when they have a
grudge against anybody, and this wild and woolly
scout is evidently anxious to stick his claws into us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe after all,” suggested Henri, “it is just because
he thinks we are spies, having seen us working
with or, rather, for the other side.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, then, didn’t he make his spring when we
were within easy reach?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You forget, Billy,” replied Henri, “that by the
time he had patched up his memory we were in Malinkoff
palace, and even the tiger of the plains would
hesitate before attempting to rough it with a Russian
duke.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And there was a good reason why he did not
have it out with us when we left the palace,” added
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A backway reason,” concluded Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian secret service, reputed to be a wonderfully
efficient system, had now advices of the activities
of that eminent arch-schemer, Roque, or
whatever other name by which he was known, in
this section of the war zone.</p>

<p class='c004'>The blowing up of the war depot in Warsaw was
less a mystery since the authorities had learned of
the presence of this dreaded operator even so close
as the width of a river.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the wily Cossack could connect our boys with
the previous movements of the aforesaid Roque,
then, as Billy would say, “good night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In Colonel Malinkoff would be vested their only
hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>That the boys were not crazy about making another
journey at present to Petrograd, goes without
saying. They would be insane if they did, of their
own accord.</p>

<p class='c004'>But, luckily, their next flying assignment was the
piloting of scouts sent out daily to observe the
maneuvers of the great army in gray, then working
on a new tack to break into the coveted city of
Warsaw.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviators operated near a battle front nearly
forty miles wide, and above a veritable hurricane of
gunpowder, but in this experience Billy and Henri
had grown old.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once away from the city, and up in the air, their
chief worry was behind them—their Cossack Nemesis
could go hang!</p>

<p class='c004'>From Salisky, now acting as observer in one of
the biplanes, the boys learned of the fall of the great
underground fortress of Przemysl, in and out of
which they had served as aerial messengers, and
where they had, not so long ago, bidden farewell
to that gallant soldier-aviator, Stanislaws.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope that ‘Stanny’ will be given a soft berth as
a prisoner,” said Billy to his chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the presence of the other airmen, however, the
boys kept discreetly silent as to their acquaintance
with the Austrian fort and town now overrun by the
Russian forces.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now and again there were days when Billy and
Henri were relieved of the strain of constant
aeroplane driving, and which was given to wandering
about the streets of busy Warsaw.</p>

<p class='c004'>One afternoon their steps inclined to the well
remembered square with the tall column and heroic
statue of bronze. In the door of a shop bearing the
symbol of a silversmith, the proprietor happened to
be standing when the boys strolled by.</p>

<p class='c004'>This tradesman, at the time without trade, suddenly
changed from sleepy attitude to one of alert
anticipation after second view of the strollers. Under
a skull cap of silk gleamed a pair of keen, blue
eyes, and the smooth-shaven face of the man was
alight with a half-smile of recognition.</p>

<p class='c004'>He lifted his right hand with a peculiar gesture,
the thumb folded into the palm.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy, idly glancing at the performer, remarked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“That fellow wants to sell you a dinner set of
fifty pieces, Buddy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That hole in the wall wouldn’t hold half of it,”
joked Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tradesman seemed puzzled at the lack of response
to his thumb signal, but he was evidently determined
to have a word with the boys.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a low bow he stepped to the middle of the
sidewalk, as if soliciting custom, and in English,
with peculiar accent, softly mentioned a familiar
term—Two Towers!</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy started as if a torpedo had exploded underfoot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where have I seen that face before?”</p>

<p class='c004'>This thought wave was instantly merged into the
sense of knowing:—</p>

<p class='c004'>The coal heaver who had presented the soiled
scrap of paper which summoned the young aviators
to the twin towers on the day of the destruction of
the war depot!</p>

<p class='c004'>That face, though now clean of grime, was the
same that had burned itself into the lad’s memory
when the stirring message was delivered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I gave you the sign and you did not respond.
Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blest if I know what you mean,” Billy told the
supposed silversmith.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it was to you that I was sent when the hour
of need was near.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now see here, for good and all, let me say that
neither my chum nor myself has any knowledge
of the inside workings about which you are trying
to talk, and what’s more we don’t want to know
anything about them. Mr. Roque showed us a lot,
but I guess he stopped somewhere this side of the
inner circle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy did not care to assume any new responsibility
which might lead Henri and himself into
some maze of mystery far beyond their depth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man addressed appeared to be puzzled at the
boy’s reference to “Mr. Roque.” He evidently
believed that Billy was fencing with him. “Kindly
step into the store for a moment; I will not detain
you long.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Though both the boys had reached the same conclusion,
that it was a sort of spider and the fly game,
they impulsively followed the leader into the little
shop.</p>

<p class='c004'>Spreading a few articles of jewelry and silverware
upon the top of the counter, as a cloak for
the line of talk he was pursuing, he quickly remarked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sometimes fear that I am a suspect, and we
cannot be too careful in these times.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy darted a look at Henri full of apprehension—“we
cannot be too careful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is no use to hide behind the bush, one from
the other, my young friends,” continued the man behind
the counter; “of course, I do not blame you
for being cautious, but now that we are past the
limit of assurance, let us get together and talk
straight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You still have the advantage of us,” insisted
Billy, glancing uneasily toward the door, as if contemplating
a hasty move in that direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>The keen blue eyes under the skull cap flashed
a threat of growing irritation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps you do not appreciate, young man,” and
the voice of the speaker sounding a harsh note, “that
we sink or swim together. It is no ordinary tie
that binds us, and woe to the one who breaks it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say, old scout,” interposed Henri, “this isn’t a
theater.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or an asylum,” added Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>How the silversmith would have resented these
strokes at his manner of dramatic declaration was
left for surmise, for at the moment his whole expression
changed to one of bland greeting at the
sight of a newcomer in the shop—a man who presented
a wide front view, wearing a military cape
and fairly bristling with authority, evidenced by his
manner of pushing open the door and his heavy
tread, which raised a creak from the floor as he
strode to the counter where the boys were standing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They have just dug something that looks like a
clock out of the ruins up there, Ricker, and as you
are the nearest time tinker around here, I want you
to come alone and see what you think of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys saw the hue of ashes in the face of the
tradesman, but the words that gave him the scare
were as Greek to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly, sir; certainly,” the silversmith was
saying, as he reached for his hat and greatcoat,
hanging on a convenient peg. Turning to the boys,
he politely directed them to the door, with an excellent
imitation of regret that their expected purchase
must be delayed by this emergency call.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the sidewalk the boys watched the turn of the
corner of the burly cape wearer and the silversmith,
the latter walking like a weary soldier on a forced
march.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s a pretty howdy-de-do, Buddy,” observed
Henri, “getting twisted up with a fellow that evidently
has a price on his head, and who thinks we
are as deep in the muddle as he is. Did you ever see
such luck?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I knew a single word in the outlandish language
spoken by that fat policeman I could tell better
about our chances of being bothered again by
the man with the thumb sign.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not the first time that Billy had been
stumped by the various lingoes in the war zone.</p>

<p class='c004'>While the boys were dreaming that night of lurid
initiation into some bloody brotherhood, there came
riding into Warsaw a bevy of splendidly mounted
horsemen, brilliantly attired in scarlet, gold-braided
caftans, white waistcoats and blue trousers—imperial
Cossacks from Petrograd!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />BETWEEN TWO FIRES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The boys were aroused in the early morning by
the shrill neighing of horses in the courtyard underneath
the windows of their sleeping quarters, and
other sounds indicating the incoming of a cavalry
troop, created sufficient inducement, at least, for an
after-waking peek at the night-riders who had cut
off a good hour of slumber.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy, the first at the window, drew back with a
sharp note of alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fancy Cossacks!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quit your jollying,” cried Henri, unbelieving,
bouncing out of his cot and barefooting it to the
lookout point. “Jumping jimminy,” he excitedly
admitted, when he saw one of the red horsemen in
the act of dismounting, “you are right, sure
enough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what are they doing here?” questioned Billy.
“This is no stableyard.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looking for us,” slyly insinuated Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe there is more truth than poetry in that
proposition.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boy from Bangor was taking the matter seriously.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the interval several Cossacks, trailing their
lances, crossed the courtyard to the main entrance
of the building where the aviators were housed, and
vigorously thumped for admission. These knights
of the plain evidently held themselves to be privileged
characters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri, getting into their clothes as
quickly as possible, poked their heads over the stair
railing, from which location they could see and hear
all that was happening in the spacious hall below.</p>

<p class='c004'>By what they heard, however, they were not enlightened,
for it was in the speech unknown to them,
but enough and plenty in the sight of no other than
the Cossack who had given them the evil eye in
Petrograd.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviation chief seemed to be strenuously saying
“no” to some question put by the giant in scarlet,
shaking his head and handsweeping over his
shoulder in directing manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>The insistent intruder finally accepted the advices
given, and with his companions again took to saddle,
spurring their horses into a clattering gallop out of
the paved enclosure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just as if they had not been watching and listening,
the boys descended the stairs, giving their usual
good morning salutations to their fellow aviators,
who had all been attracted to the hall by the discussion
just concluded.</p>

<p class='c004'>To give the lads an understanding with the rest
as to what it had all been about, the chief mingled
French and English in his explanation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That big fellow is Nikita, who has been attached
to the imperial service on account of his skill and
daring as a scout. I heard a story about him only
the other day. Along with ten comrades, he was
captured through falling into an ambuscade. Three
days later he turned up at the camp of his command
with two bullets, one through his clothes, and one
through his thigh. He was horseless, but carried
his long lance. Without horse or weapons, he had
crept during darkness from the tent in which he
slept, got safely past the German sentries, and then
reflected that it was a shame for a Cossack to lose
his horse and lance. So, as the story goes, he crept
back, recovered both horse and lance and galloped
away. The horse was killed by a shot from an
outpost, but I see that Nikita still has his lance. I tell
you that this is a breed that never lets go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This last comment had a jarring effect upon both
Billy and Henri. The latter, however, did not restrain
a desire for some direct information:</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a fine story, lieutenant, but it doesn’t tell
what this wonderful warrior wanted here this morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He demanded an interview with the dispatch
bearers who aeroplaned into Petrograd on a certain
date—the same date, by the way, upon which you
were detailed as pilots for Marovitch and Salisky.
I had difficulty in convincing the Cossack that the
men he was seeking were at present scouting along
the Vistula south of Warsaw.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where I wish we were this very minute.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy had edged close to Henri to say it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviation chief further advised that the Cossacks
had gone to the general’s quarters, and would
probably remain in Warsaw until they had completed
a mission, of which he (the chief) knew nothing
about, but which apparently had to do with some
recent happening in Petrograd.</p>

<p class='c004'>Right there the boys made up their minds that
they had all the rest they needed, and Billy, as
spokesman, so informed the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If there are any air scouts going out to-day,”
said the boy, “we want to be on the job.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, my birds,” agreed the lieutenant, “you
will be marked first on the list.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When at last the aerial assignment of the boys
for the day was made they were greatly interested
to learn that the flight was to be directly across the
river, in which direction they had never traveled
since the day they came into the city by the written
directions of Roque.</p>

<p class='c004'>The observers they were to pilot were immediately
identified with the general’s staff, and the
young aviators were duly advised of the rank of
their passengers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They all look alike to me,” remarked Henri, as
he and his chum waited at the hangars for the order
to start—“all except Colonel Malinkoff, and he’s
my pick every time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless, the pilots showed proper deference
when the officers boarded the aircraft, after briefly
outlining the plan of journey. The boys did not
take the time nor assume the trouble of telling that
they needed no guide notes for this particular voyage!</p>

<p class='c004'>The same old entrenchments skirted the mud-colored
river, but thinly populated now, for the main
body of German soldiery there had joined in the
new move upon Warsaw from the northwest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri had each an eye for their former
earthy lodging, and marked in memory the very
spot in the battlefield where the French boy had
landed the firebrand Schneider for his desperate
dash in rescue of the grounded colors.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of the fate of the secret agent and his fighting attendant,
however, no tidings came up from the mottled
plain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Somebody might know in the clean, white lodge-keeper’s
kitchen, where the canary sang, but there
was no available excuse to turn downward the
swiftly sailing biplanes when they swept over the
one bright spot in all that forbidding surface.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can recommend your license as master pilots,”
jovially observed one of the officers when the machines
again rested in the aviation field, just at sunset.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other observer nodded approval of the compliment
to the youngsters, and both found it not
beneath their dignity to give Billy and Henri a
hearty handshake.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviators had hardly completed the
housing of the biplanes when they were accosted by
a loutish lad attired in a smock-frock and leather
leggins.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a pull at his forelock, the boy handed Billy
a fold of notepaper, and then shuffled away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some more shady business,” muttered Billy,
opening the message.</p>

<p class='c004'>One line, that was all:</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-morrow noon. Sign of thumb.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why can’t that fellow let us alone?”</p>

<p class='c004'>With the petulant words Billy tore the note to
shreds and cast them to the wind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Between the Cossack and this alleged silversmith,”
complained Henri, “we will have more than
enough practice as artful dodgers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Got us both going and coming,” gloomily added
Billy, “and no show for argument.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We don’t have to respond to that message, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know about that, Henri; we might be
able to convince the crank at the shop that we
haven’t any hold on underground wires, and so get
rid of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And then prove an alibi when we meet that Cossack.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri wore a grin as he put this extra spoke in
the wheel of hope that his chum was turning.</p>

<p class='c004'>Humor, however, was not catching to Billy this
evening. The boys sat in silence at the mess table,
and as silently stole away to bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviators had no call for their services
the next day, and Billy insisted that they play a quitting
visit to the little shop in the square. Besides,
he had urged, they were less likely to encounter the
Cossack out in the big city than if they idled about
headquarters. His motion prevailed, and shortly
before the tower clocks sounded the twelve strokes,
the chums were rounding the tall column and nearing
the symbol of the silversmith.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker had an assistant on duty in front this day,
a wild-eyed individual literally overgrown with hair
on head and face. When the boys entered the shop
the queer-looking clerk spoke not a word, but simply
pounded with his knuckles on the counter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The proprietor of the place quickly appeared from
a curtained recess at the rear of the shop, and
crooked a finger in beckoning invitation to the visitors
to come back and join him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hairy assistant went to the street door, and
after peering up and down the avenue, nodded clearance
to his chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys perched themselves on a couple of high
stools in the work room, while Ricker leaned against
a low and broad shelf covered with equipment of the
clockmaker’s trade.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was determined to settle matters there and
then and get clear of an annoying and dangerous
complication.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is the last time,” he bluntly stated, “that
we will stand for a call here. Just as I told you
before, there was a limit to our knowledge of Mr.
Roque’s affairs, and as he did not choose to take us
all the way, we have no desire to be dragged along
by any stranger. Running aeroplanes is our business,
and we are not seeking to acquire any other
profession. So it’s farewell on the spot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker showed a red flush of anger rising to his
cheekbones, but he tempered his reply to the boy’s
declaration. “Stick to your flying trade, young man,
as you will, but on your service the Cause has a
claim, and the penalty for ignoring that claim will
be exacted to the last farthing, be it blood or bones.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The implied threat put a tingle in Billy’s spirited
makeup, and, jumping from the stool, he impetuously
took up the challenge of the silversmith with
wordy proclamation:</p>

<p class='c004'>“When we leave this place, understand me, we
don’t return, and, again, not the slightest bit of attention
do we pay to any further communication
from you. You get me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker put another curb on his temper, and his
tone was even and subdued, slightly tinged with
mockery as he replied to Billy’s forceful speech:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bluff beautifully, my young friend, but for
one who was hand and glove with the great Herr
Georges you wear your chains too lightly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Herr Georges? Is he another growth in your
mind?” Billy happened to think at the instant that
“Georges” and “Roque” were one and the same person—as
the secret agent changed his name as many
times and as easily as he changed his clothes. But
he let the question go as put, for a feeler, if nothing
else.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you know the one I mean, though you and
I are seemingly at odds in naming him,” confidently
asserted Ricker.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what of that?” argued Billy. “For all we
know, Roque or Georges is beyond interest in the
doings of earth, and, what’s more, we have paid
our score and have been acquitted of the service.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The silversmith turned thoughtful for the moment,
hesitating as to his next word. Then, deliberately,
he questioned:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean to tell me that you knew nothing
of the plot to blow up the war depot?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys stared at the questioner in affright!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />TRAILED BY RED RIDERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The silversmith seemed satisfied that he had effectually
unseated Billy from his highhorse position,
and in cat and mouse attitude awaited complete
surrender.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You—you dare to voice that suspicion?” gasped
the boy. “We never heard or even dreamed of such
a plot, and with the coming of the shock hadn’t the
least idea what caused it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it not true that the pair of you at the very
moment of the explosion were preparing to speed
in aeroplanes to the rescue of at least two of the plotters?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker smiled as he presented what appeared to
him to be a poser.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only half a truth,” cried Henri, “with the worst
half added by you. We did intend to offer Roque
a saving turn in one of his own machines, for old
acquaintance sake, but not in the connection that
you put it. For even that much, I know, you have
us against the wall, but let me tell you, sir, if the
worst comes to the worst we will confess our part to
our friend Colonel Malinkoff and he can weigh the
testimony that the three of us can give.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This dropped Ricker, not only to a seat on a
workbench, but in point of argument. Just back
of him were the battered remains of a time-clock,
with twisted wires still attached, for the custody of
which he was responsible to the authorities, and
about which, as an expert, he was expected to report
the next morning. It was a part of the infernal
machine dug out of the ruins of the war depot!</p>

<p class='c004'>Both Billy and Henri were quick to observe that
the silversmith was about all in, so to speak, and
more than willing to play quits.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man who had missed his reckoning an hour
in the setting of a spring was not now disposed to
perpetuate the error!</p>

<p class='c004'>As the boys were about to push aside the curtain
and get out into the open, a small bell suspended
from the ceiling of the workroom softly tinkled.
Ricker was on his feet in an instant and holding a
finger to his lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the store entrance some rapid-fire Russian was
being exchanged, and Billy took the liberty of
peeping through a slit in the drapery behind which he
was concealed. The look was a blood freezer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nikita, the Cossack, and the hairy clerk were having
it hammer and tongs about something, when all
of a sudden the red rider unhanded one of his heavy
leather gloves and with it struck the queer shop attendant
full in the face.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of all the malignant looks that Billy had ever
seen on human countenance the blackest was pictured
in the glaring eyes of the fierce servitor, who,
retreating before the assaulting Cossack, had backed
against the counter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker, catching the drift of the quarrel in front,
turned quickly, and noiselessly pushed aside, in well-oiled
grooves, a solid-back plate case, and to the
opening revealed in the wall he beckoned the boys.
“He is evidently after you, for some reason,” whispered
the silversmith; “claims that he trailed you
here. Is he friend or foe? Tell me quick.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Without a word, Billy and Henri classed the
hunter outside as a decided enemy by hurriedly slipping
through the aperture, the case smoothly shutting
the way behind them.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not in the program of Ricker that his shop
should be the scene of an arrest, and, too, it was now
in his interest that the boys should escape the probe
of any investigation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having disposed of this dangerous exhibit in his
back room, the silversmith hastened to the front to
pacify, if possible, the unruly intruder.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker, showing his best professional smile,
stepped between the frowning Cossack and the enraged
clerk, speaking a sharp word of warning to
the latter, and asking the former what it was that
he desired.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, two boys, air drivers, you say? I know
them not. Reported to be in my shop? There cannot
be good eyesight around here. Everything is
open. This way, please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The silversmith moved backward, closely followed
by the Cossack and several others of his kind,
and pulled the curtains aside, with a sweeping gesture
of invitation to search at will.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though the keenest of trackers in the great outdoors,
the red riders were at a loss when it came to
detective work within four walls. They prodded
with their lances bundles of wrapping paper in the
several dark corners of the workroom and poked
their heads into all of the packing cases, but with
cunningly designed entrances into secret apartments
they had no experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last, scowling and grumbling, the baffled
searchers marched themselves out of the shop. As
the Cossack, Nikita, passed out the queer clerk
shook a fist at the crimson-clad back, mumbling
frightful maledictions to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The silversmith assumed a busy manner, shifting
the stock display on the shelves, winding clocks, and
generally bustling about as if making up for lost
time.</p>

<p class='c004'>All this time the boys were completely shut off
from every sight and sound in the musty room behind
the plate-case.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wonder how long this lockup is going to last,
Henri?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Until the shutters are put up in front, I suppose,
Billy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s entirely too long for me,” impatiently asserted
the boy from Bangor. “Let’s see if there
isn’t some other outlet to this den.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But with all the sounding and pounding they
could do, the lads found no back way to the dismal
room.</p>

<p class='c004'>And, too, they were baffled again and again by
the mechanism of the sliding door by which they
had entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing more to do than to await the pleasure of
the silversmith, and so they awaited, hour upon
hour, seated on a rickety sofa, nursing their chins in
their hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>The one little, cobwebby window at the top of
the dingy wall in front of them no longer showed
light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then there was a click, a faint squeak, and Ricker
appeared in the opening, cleared by the movement
of the sliding case.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have they gone?” eagerly inquired Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Apparently so, but Hamar is out now to make
sure that they have not set a watch on the place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’ll be somebody else hunting for us if we
don’t get away pretty soon, and that will be a squad
from headquarters. The lieutenant,” concluded
Billy, “is mighty particular about the off-duty hours
that the aviators keep.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hamar, the hairy lieutenant, had been a long time
gone, and Ricker had difficulty in persuading the
boys to lay quiet until positive assurance came that
the coast was clear. With the next striking of the
big clock in the square—it was eight—Billy declared
against further delay.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I really believe that Marovitch and Salisky have
returned, without reason to the contrary have given
the Cossack what they know of our history and
identified us with the last trip to Petrograd. So
what’s the use of further dodging? It will all come
out, and if they hitch us onto the explosion plot—well,
you can guess the rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker squirmed in his chair. “Say,” he pleaded,
“hide here for a day or two and we will find a way
to get you both across the river.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” declared Henri. “I’m going to put it up
to Colonel Malinkoff this very night. He can, and
I believe he will, save us from the fate of spies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what about me? Am I to be betrayed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The silversmith’s right hand was buried to the
wrist within the breast-front of the loose coat he
wore.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a muffled knock at the front door,
twice repeated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hamar,” muttered the silversmith, lowering his
hand. “Stay where you are,” he hissed to the boys.
With the turning of a ponderous key the wild-eyed
servitor, hooded to the shoulders, pushed his way
through the space in the half-opened door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where in Satan’s name have you been?” growled
Ricker.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hairy man laughed—and it was a laugh to
curdle the blood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV.' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />THE POISONED RING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Stow that yelp,” commanded Ricker; “it sets
one’s teeth on edge. What are you playing the
clown for, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hamar threw back his hood, and with the black
mane draping his temples and mingling with the
mat on his face, eye and tooth glittering in the
shaded glow of the swinging lamp overhead, he was
the living picture of a fabled fury.</p>

<p class='c004'>In words that ran in a stream of gutturals, deep
in his throat, he told the story of the adventure that
had prolonged his street scouting-mission, and here
liberally translated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sold him the ring—the very red man that
struck me in the face—it was a rare work; he knew
me not, my head down and covered. His dirty
roubles—see?” (Hamar opened a clenched hand,
in the palm of which were several silver coins.) “He
has it on his finger. I told him it would bring him
good luck—bring him to the worms I meant. Ha,
ha. Go you,” addressing the boys; “no fear now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker stood dumfounded at the completion of
this outburst. Then he faced the young aviators,
who had been held spellbound by the weird performance—meaning
the actions, for the words were
mere gibberish to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know what he has done?” exclaimed the
silversmith—“why, he has put the death ring on the
Cossack!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Going behind the counter, Ricker took from under
the glass case a tiny chamois bag and shook it
over the polished surface. The bag was empty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This man, I tell you,” the silversmith cried, aiming
an index finger at Hamar, who had relapsed into
sullen indifference, “is a fanatic, not a patriot, and
serves not for any government, but against all governments.
That blow in the face went to his very
soul, and here’s the result. What he has taken and
used to wreak personal vengeance is known as a possession
of mine, a curio, and often displayed to the
curious, for the ring had this peculiarity—it is poisoned.
The heat of the finger starts a poison to
work that lies in the setting—whoever decorates his
hand with it is dead in two weeks!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, dead, dead,” mumbled Hamar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And woe to me if the foxes from the division of
justice are in at the death; is it not enough,” groaned
the silversmith, “that I am now beset on all sides?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The passing thought to Billy and Henri—the
wearing of the terrible jewel would rid them of their
savage foe and avert a trial for their lives.</p>

<p class='c004'>But, shuddering, the boys resented even the
thought of such a relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>The one overpowering impulse with both of them
at the moment was to get out and away from this
ferment of intrigue and passion, out into the free
air, anywhere that offered a change.</p>

<p class='c004'>With this end in view the lads had been slowly
but surely edging, inch by inch, foot by foot, nearer
the door, under cover of the exciting controversy
between Ricker and his hairy henchman.</p>

<p class='c004'>One twist of the key, a pull at the knob, and the
trick was done.</p>

<p class='c004'>But any mishap, a stumble, a catch in the lock,
and Ricker and Hamar would be on their backs.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Henri, lightning fast in every movement,
who essayed the first jump for the door. It was
done in an instant when the silversmith, who was
nervously pacing the floor, had faced the curtain in
the rear of the store, and while Hamar had lifted his
arms in the act of unfastening the loops that closed
the collar of his heavy greatcoat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The work of a second, and the bolt snapped back
in the lock, the door rattled on its hinges by the force
of its opening, and two lithe figures leaped out into
the night!</p>

<p class='c004'>If they were pursued they never knew it, for a
deer would hardly have been in the running with
them as they dashed across the square.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once in the great avenue diverging northward,
the lads again breathed freely, but wasted no time
in making their way to aviation headquarters. If
they had expected to be immediately hauled before
stern judges to show cause why they should be permitted
to live, they were agreeably disappointed.
Not even the lieutenant was there to inquire about
their overstay of leave.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t get that horrid ring business out of my
mind,” said Henri, half rising from his cot, after
the tired boys had supposedly settled for much
needed rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither can I,” promptly agreed Billy, who was
just as wide awake as when he first jammed the pillow
under his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you suppose it might have been that those
fellows invented that story just for our benefit?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not a chance, Henri,” replied the U. S. A. boy;
“that man Ricker is an actor all right, but in this
show he was real; I’ll lay my life on that. And don’t
tell me that the long-haired guy wasn’t in earnest.
Steer me clear of him on a dark night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think we ought to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>No sleep for Henri until this question was settled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There you are,” said the sorely perplexed chum;
“if we go to warn the Cossack it may not blunt the
claws he has sharpened for us; if we tell it straight
it will put Ricker on the rack, for nobody would
believe that the crank who wished the ring on the
red man did it of his own accord, and with Ricker
against the wall there’s no telling how far he would
go to fix us good and plenty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it was a fair fight like Schneider put up,” argued
Henri, “it would be no strain of conscience,
but to let slow poison work when we could stop it,
it seems to me, would class us as first-aid assassins.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no other way then,” decided Billy, “but
to get the tip, somehow, to the Cossack in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>If Nikita got the “tip” it did not happen in Warsaw,
for the boys were informed in response to their
break-of-day inquiry that the lance-bearing cavalryman
had, the afternoon previous, been urgently
summoned by aerial messenger to report at the
headquarters of the greatest of Russian military commanders,
a hundred miles east of Warsaw.</p>

<p class='c004'>On steeds of tireless breed, and racing with the
wind, the red riders had a long start of now these
many hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that’s the end of it,” declared Henri, when
told that the Cossack band was by this time far
away, and by route known only to themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was as deep in thought just then as were his
hands in his pockets.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter with chasing them in the
biplanes?” he suddenly asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Man alive,” cried Henri, “it is the very ticket!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV.' class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />STRIKING IT RIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>How to bring about the flying assignment that
would put them on the trail of the otherwise doomed
Cossack was the next problem to engage the young
aviators.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys well knew that aeroplane connection was
being constantly maintained between Warsaw and
the center of Russian operations at Brest Litovsk,
one hundred miles east, even though numerous telegraph
instruments, in the schoolhouse there occupied
as headquarters by the mighty commander,
ticked messages every minute day and night.</p>

<p class='c004'>No weather conditions served to check modern
aircraft, and hostile wire-cutters had nothing but
the laugh due them when it came to intercepting or
destroying aeroplane communication.</p>

<p class='c004'>How much they would be compelled to tell to
create an emergency for their journey, the boys had
no fixed idea.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s try it first on the lieutenant,” suggested
Billy, “and if he doesn’t see the way, have a talk
direct with Colonel Malinkoff.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whatever is to be done must be done at once,”
declared Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>So they jointly proceeded in search of the aviation chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>As though a change of luck had succeeded the recent
adverse fortune assailing the lads, whom should
they meet in crossing the aviation grounds but
Salisky and Marovitch, the scouts and special messengers
lately back from important mission to the
front.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Joy of my heart,” was the hail of Salisky, at
sight of the pilots who had made the record flight
from Petrograd, “if here isn’t the salt of the earth
in two good packages.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His companion observer showed equal pleasure
in greeting the lads, and the four of them had a
busy moment voicing questions and answers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thought you had skipped with the Cossacks,”
bantered Salisky; “the big chief of the riders put me
through a regular course of sprouts in trying to get
a line on you. I knew precious little, except that
you were the right stuff and more than full hands
in an aeroplane. Did he find you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not that anybody knows about,” replied Billy,
“but we would like to find him just now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You would have a noble chance of making that
discovery if you were going with us,” put in Marovitch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are you going?” was Henri’s eager
query.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In two hours we will be in full sail for Brest
Litovsk,” announced Salisky.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys each took an elbow grip on the speaker.</p>

<p class='c004'>With one voice they cried: “Count us in on the
flight, if you can!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suits me all right,” promptly agreed Salisky,
“but it is the lieutenant who names the pilots, and
we are hunting for him now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s the very man we have been looking for
ourselves,” said Billy, “and we are more in a hurry
than ever to get hold of him. Come along.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviation chief had just emerged from the
house quarters of a brother officer when the searchers
surrounded him, Salisky presenting a written
order, and the boys with difficulty refraining from
putting their request in advance of the reading.</p>

<p class='c004'>Indeed, the lieutenant had barely comprehended
the text of the official billet before Henri was talking
in one ear and Billy in the other. It was breach
of discipline for which any of the veterans in the
aviation corps would have forthwith been called
down, but exuberant youth could not be denied.</p>

<p class='c004'>The upshot of it was that the young aviators carried
their point, having the hearty endorsement of
the two men directly responsible for the success of
the mission assigned to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Talk about striking it right,” rejoiced Billy as
Henri and himself were getting into suitable outfit
for a long drive in the cold; “it certainly seems as
if our good fairy were on the job to-day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe it was good intent that had something to
do with the shaping of this venture,” added Henri.
“It isn’t just like we were backing this effort with
a solely selfish motive. If we have nothing to gain
we might have everything to lose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come to think of it in that light,” said Billy,
“if we don’t gain as much as the point at which we
are aiming, it is somebody else that will lose—the
Cossack will be minus his life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A corporal was calling from the hall below, and
the pilots hastened to report themselves at the
hangars where the military biplanes—the famous
No. 3’s—were in trim for instant flight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Salisky and Marovitch were ready and waiting,
and at the signal from the aviation chief the
aeroplanes were off like a shot, soon to be in touch with
the directing power of the biggest army under one
command in the world’s history of warfare—the
Russian forces maneuvered by Grand Duke Nicholas
along a battle front of 1,500 miles.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet in all the legions before them the hooded
pilots, holding hard to the compass-set course of the
winged cyclones, would first have eyes for but one
equestrian figure, scarlet clad, with a sleeping death
coiled in his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the observers behind them the Boy Aviators
had withheld all mention of the original incentive
for this particular service—but the time was approaching
when this confidence must be extended.
As well address an Eskimo in Arabic as to trip the
tongues the lads knew over the language knowledge
of Nikita, the wild horseman.</p>

<p class='c004'>They must speak through the city-bred Muscovites
with whom they were traveling—friends in
need.</p>

<p class='c004'>The main thing was to locate immediately the
man they would warn and save, and with this end
in view, a plea had been made to the observers to
give note if in the sweep of their glasses they caught
the ground picture of the crimson cavalcade.</p>

<p class='c004'>But not once during the flight was there even a
snapshot of anything like that picture—and it must
needs be a waiting game, to be finished with the
journey’s end.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI.' class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />THE END OF THE CHASE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A thin, spare figure rising to a height of over six
and a half feet, in field uniform, without a show of
ribbon, cross or medal, grim, silent and determined—this
was the remarkable personality pointed out
to the boys as the military head of the enormous
army of seven million men.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviators had landed within a few hundred
yards of the headquarters of the Russian commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Salisky and Marovitch had reported to an
adjutant and turned over the contents of their dispatch
boxes to the proper authority, the time was
opportune for the young airmen to solicit the aid
of the veteran scouts in accomplishing that which
they had set out to do.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are sure that nothing has turned your
head?” anxiously inquired Salisky, when he had
heard, in part, the thrilling story of the death ring
and its secret menace to the life of Nikita.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not cracked,” earnestly assured Billy, so
earnestly indeed that his hearers’ unbelief was considerably
modified, and both observers began to
realize that the strange tale was not altogether the
creation of a disordered mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Marovitch even recalled hearing some talk at one
time of some such historical jewel owned in Warsaw,
but memory failed him when it came to placing it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys had said nothing to specify the former
ownership of the dread decoration, and so did not
repair this defect in the scout’s recollection.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Taking it all seriously,” remarked Salisky, now
about convinced that it was no myth with which
they were dealing, “there is the duty of getting to
the Cossack chief without delay. Death is an everyday
visitor around here, but not in the form of slow
poison, and there is peculiar interest enough in this
idea of rescue to key us all up to high pitch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Marovitch, too, shared his comrade’s growing
concern as to the importance of quick action. The
driving force of intense interest inspired them all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Consider their disappointment, then, when it was
learned at headquarters that Nikita and his band
had been but an hour in this camp, and were already
pushing on toward Petrograd.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s where we stop, according to orders,” regretfully
stated Salisky, “and I don’t know for how
long, either.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is there no earthly way to get a release?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was hoping against hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not unless by new instruction,” responded the
scout.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you suppose the ring story would let us out?”
asked Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t believe at all that they would swallow it,”
advised Marovitch; “besides, it would probably take
a lot of time to hit the trail of the red riders. Too
much space out there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The speaker referred to the vast and trackless territory
at the north.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their first night in Brest Litovsk was not a happy
one to the young aviators. They had set their hearts
and minds to the mission of nullifying the vengeful
scheme of Hamar, the very knowledge of which
spelled guilt to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>And here all their plans were as naught in the face
of inexorable military rule, which held them fast
until new commands succeeded the original order.</p>

<p class='c004'>An attempt to steal away in one of the biplanes
would be simply reckless folly, and of no avail—they
had no definite advices as to the direction even
that the Cossack band had taken in their proposed
journey to the Russian capital, direct or roundabout,
and, in addition, there was the fear that without an
interpreter it would be equally foolish to approach
Nikita, even though they located him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The measure of life for the Cossack, with the
death ring encircling his finger, fixed by Ricker as
two weeks, and handed down, no doubt, with record
of the ancient jewel, was still an uncertain quantity.
It might be in this very hour that the slowly
coursing venom had done its work.</p>

<p class='c004'>The favor of just another day for the boys’ venture
was needed to save it from hopeless failure.
Once on the trail there was always the chance of
making timely discovery; a continued internment in
this camp, and there was left nothing but the distress
of defeat and the reverse flight to Warsaw.</p>

<p class='c004'>Would the streak of luck that in the first place
had shunted the lads into the coveted aeroplane
space be extended?</p>

<p class='c004'>It so developed that that was just what happened,
and Salisky was the early bird who brought the
good news to the blanket bedsides of the drowsy
pilots.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is a regiment of Turkomans reported on
the move, riding up to the north line, and there is
an order out for aeroplane service to convey directions
to these troops from headquarters. Marovitch
and I have the assignment—and that means our
pilots, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Doesn’t that cover the route to Petrograd?”
quickly questioned Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As far as two hundred and fifty miles,” advised
Salisky.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bully! Do you hear that, Henri?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I guess yes, Buddy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who are the Turkomans, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy wanted to learn a little every day.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are our new cavalry force,” explained
Salisky, “and they are even quicker to ride at a
fence of bayonets than the Don Cossacks, and that
is saying something. They came from the desert,
the oasis and the steppes of the Trans-Caspian provinces,
as well as Caucasia, and they come of their
own accord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A famous fighting lot, that,” added Marovitch,
“and of all the horsemen I have ever seen, these fellows
are in the lead as whirlwind riders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll look good to us,” exclaimed Billy, “especially
as they are the means of getting us out of
here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>While the scout-messengers were waiting for
their orders, the boys put the biplanes in flying trim,
and the party were off for the frozen north within
the hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviators had never seen entrenchments
laid out on such a tremendous scale as in the early
passing of this flight, and noted with wonder the
fortifications set up by the Russians in the open field.</p>

<p class='c004'>What Napoleon had once called the “fifth element”—Russian
mud—was now sheeted with snow,
and the great rivers and swamps were covered with
ice—an impressive outlook with a real chill in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But of dead white scenery the young pilots had
grown weary; with them the miles they left behind
were of chief consequence—and full many a league
had then been rolled backward under the top-speeding
aeroplanes.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was at Vilna, where the observers had been directed
to go, that first landing was made by the
aviators, and following which the scouts had advices
of the near approach of the Turkomans.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon sight of these picturesque cavalrymen, who
feared neither hardship nor danger, the boys were
surprised at the youth of most of them, and for
whom it had been said, “war is the great and only
poem, their unique dream and faith.”</p>

<p class='c004'>These bold riders wore dark-brown caftans, and
full headdress, instead of the usual lambskin
cap.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sons of princes, khans or beks, the officers
of these troops were keenly shrewd and intelligent,
as well as fiery and impetuous.</p>

<p class='c004'>They gave the envoys from army headquarters a
respectful hearing, and in every way set back a
common belief that the Turkomans generally were
merely hordes without discipline.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of greater interest than all else in the proceedings,
as far as Billy and Henri were concerned, was
the statement from a Turkoman chief brought out
by inquiry from Salisky, and by the latter interpreted,
that only the day before, traveling due northwest,
the brown riders had met the red-clad Nikita
and his comrade Cossacks at the crossing of the
Duna River.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One day’s ride, he says,” translated Salisky, “but
he measures by the gait of a horse. Even counting
upon the fact that the Cossacks have done some
galloping since this meeting, it is no task to overhaul
them now in our aeroplanes, providing, of
course, we do not miss their trail. I will tell you
what we will do,” continued the scout; “Marovitch
and I will chance an extra dozen hours for this side
expedition, but that is the limit of our discretion.
We have no choice but to return to headquarters,
and depend upon you drivers to make up most of
the lost time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will get all there is in the motors,” assured
Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>The upshoot of the biplanes presented a spectacular
leave-taking to the horsemen, and they raised
their lances on high in appreciation of the show.</p>

<p class='c004'>The twelve hours allotted would have been all too
brief in which to serve the purpose intended had
the searching party been dependent upon ordinary
means of locomotion, and with less wide range of
vision.</p>

<p class='c004'>But in less than three hours the biplanes had
swept across the river mentioned by the Turkoman
as the place of meeting with Nikita, and onrushed,
with occasional deviations right and left from
straight course, at hurricane speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The machines had traveled some fifty miles on the
north side of the Duna, when a shout from Marovitch,
in the craft driven by Henri, caused the pilot
to suddenly set the planes for descent.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the glittering white surface of the steppe there
appeared a new color effect—moving discs of scarlet!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />BROTHERS OF THE BLOOD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The Cossacks rode in a wide circle, ’round and
’round the settled aeroplanes, at which the wild
ponies snorted and seemingly feared to approach.</p>

<p class='c004'>When, however, Salisky and Marovitch each gave
vent to one of those weird calls peculiar to the denizens
of the desert, the tribesmen drove their shaggy
mounts full speed toward the searching party.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nikita was the first to dismount. He knew the
scouts, and gave them guttural greeting. The
question in his keen eyes, though, did not sound
from the lips. He had caught a glimpse of the boys,
still seated in the biplanes. The tall chief was instantly
a-quiver with a certain fierce joy of possession—that
which he desired had apparently been
delivered into his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bring these young dogs to me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We bring to you, chief, brave lads who have
risked much for your welfare—for your life, chief,
for your very life!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Salisky, who had no knowledge of that past,
wherein had crossed the paths of Nikita and these
boys, and sizing only the present purpose of his
young friends, was inclined to indignantly resent
the address of the Cossack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“With my life what have they to do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>To the red rider the reply of Salisky was a riddle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are but spies,” he continued accusingly,
“and upon the heads of their kind is the blood of
my brother.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The speaker supplemented his words with a
menacing movement toward the young pilots, who
were wholly ignorant of the nature of this parley.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The voice of Salisky had a hard note, and conveyed
no double meaning.</p>

<p class='c004'>Marovitch ranged alongside of his comrade, and
each of the scouts rested a hand on the holsters attached
to their belts.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Cossacks, with lowered lances, closed in behind
their chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>Anything might have happened in the next minute
if Billy, noting the trend of action, had not
pushed himself to the front, and made eloquent plea
to Salisky to avoid the threatened encounter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Explain to him,” cried the boy; “tell him right
off the bat what we are here for; ask him about
the ring; spar for time; scout, spar for time!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nikita, seeing this new breeze blow into the squall,
was curious to know what the pleading was about.
He grounded his lance, and his companions followed suit.
The scouts relaxed their grip on their
side arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>The atmosphere had cleared a bit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Acting upon the urgent suggestion of Billy, the
scout, Salisky took the straight line in his talk to
the Cossack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bought a ring in Warsaw, chief?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nikita nodded, tapping a leather pouch at his
girdle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is not wearing it,” whispered Henri to his
chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are on time then,” said Billy, with a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of what concern of yours is this bauble?”
Nikita was asking. He had taken the jewel from
the pouch, and the glittering circlet was exposed
in the open palm of his gauntlet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is beautiful enough for a courtier to offer
to his emperor,” murmured Marovitch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Save the thought!” exclaimed Salisky. “There
is death in it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nikita, holding the ring between thumb and forefinger,
as if admiring its brilliancy, awaited further
speech from Salisky.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of what concern, I say,” he repeated, “is it of
yours that I paid my roubles for this shining thing?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of this concern, chief,” impressively declared
the scout addressed, “that with it on your finger
you would be pointing your way to the grave; that
with it on your finger in a few days the wolves
might be snarling over your swollen corpse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Cossack shook his head, and turned to his
comrades, with a significant shrug of the shoulders,
as much as to say that somebody’s mind was wandering.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell him that the man of whom he bought the
ring,” urged Billy, “had sworn revenge for a blow
inflicted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Salisky put the information in form of understanding
to the Cossack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nikita dropped his manner of incredulity like
a shot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A blow. Now I remember; it was in the place
where led the trail of these spies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Drop that last, chief,” angrily challenged Salisky.
“These boys, as I told you, have sought you
day and night to save your life. Were they what
you claim, is it likely that they would so desperately
attempt to overturn that which would quietly remove
one who hungered to lay them low? Have
a thought, chief.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nikita was thinking, the savage in him was receding.
He looked attentively at the death ring
poised in his finger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he cast the jewel downward to the ice-encrusted
surface at his feet, and ground its shimmering
facets under the pointed heel of his cavalry
boot.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Cossack had accepted as the whole truth the
story of the ancient ring, and as fully realized the
stated intent of these strange boys, who had raced
with death that he, their deadly enemy, might retain
the boon of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>He spoke rapidly to his comrades, queer phrases
that even the scouts did not comprehend.</p>

<p class='c004'>That some sort of ceremony was under way was
demonstrated by the next move of the tribesmen,
when Billy and Henri became centerpieces in the
parti-colored cluster of lance bearers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The scouts, showing no disposition to interfere,
the boys were convinced that the attentions paid to
them were now wholly of a friendly nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>But a severe test of such belief was furnished by
Nikita, as the latter drew near to the lads, carrying
in his right hand a dagger, with the point turned
forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>Only a reassuring glance from Salisky kept the
young aviators from giving ground before the
threatening advance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nikita, pausing before Billy, reached for the latter’s
wrist, lifted it, made a tiny puncture near a
smaller artery, and with the same dagger point
slightly scarified his own wrist.</p>

<p class='c004'>With Henri identically the same transfer of blood
corpuscles passed from himself to the Cossack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon each of the boys the Cossack then bestowed
an amulet—lance points of flint, curiously marked,
and with holes in the center, through which thongs
had been drawn.</p>

<p class='c004'>Translating the words of presentation, Salisky
with due solemnity advised the young friends that
“now and thereafter they were protected from anything
that cuts or points, knives or daggers, carbines,
long or short rifles, lances, against all kinds
of metal, be it iron or steel, brass or lead, ore or
wood, when in the hands of the Don Cossacks.
This day and forever they were the adopted of the
tribesmen of Southern Russia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All the degrees at once,” said Billy, in undertone
to Henri, while the latter was alternating a wondering
eye between the thonged charm he was holding
and the stern-visaged giver thereof.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You never can tell but what these things might
prove useful in a pinch around here,” was the side
remark of the French boy, who had taken the ceremony
more seriously than his chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had occasion later on to remind Billy of this
observation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you suppose he resisted the temptation
of decorating his fist with that showy band?” was
a new query that just occurred to the irrepressible
one. “Put it across, Salisky.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The scout, in his own way, made the inquiry.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To one of our great, far away, had I planned to
give it—and woe to me if I had.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Salisky satisfied Billy’s curiosity by rewording
the answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is one thing I am sorry about, now that
the deck is cleared,” said Henri, “and that is the
forced implication of Hamar—he’s a gone gosling,
I fear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t worry about that,” replied Billy; “from
the way things looked when we skipped the shop,
I am pretty sure that the whole outfit has
disappeared by this time. We could not help it, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>While the boys were exchanging confidences, the
Cossacks had mounted their ponies, preparatory to
resuming their interrupted journey. As a last reminder
of their new relations, the red riders, headed
by the chief, rode in single file past the initiated
brethren, giving each the sign of the lifted lance—the
“high sign,” as Billy put it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-by, old top,” sang out the boy from Bangor;
“glad everything is on the square now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The scouts looked reproof at this manner of address,
but as the Cossack did not understand a word
of it, no harm was done.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Farewell, brothers,” called Henri, with more
decorum.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is our turn now,” briskly broke in Salisky,
“and I want some speeding to make our faces good
at headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will get it,” was Billy’s comeback when
the young aviators started the buzz in the biplanes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will take a week to get the water out of my
eyes,” laughed Marovitch, when the machines
dipped that evening into the camp at Brest Litovsk.</p>

<p class='c004'>Expected orders for the dash back to Warsaw
were not forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviators were destined to view the river Vistula
at an entirely different point—to see it again
tumbling down from the snow-dad Carpathians,
where the titanic war struggle raged with unabated
vigor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />THE AVIATORS’ PLEDGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For several days, from behind the lines, the Boy
Aviators had watched the Russian attack upon the
heights on the north declivities of the Carpathians,
in desperate endeavor to open a path to the highest
ridges commanding the mountain wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their own inaction on the edge of terrific combat,
pouring in and out of Uzsok, Lupkow, and
Dukla passes, had been nerve-racking. The roar of
battle never ceased, day or night, and among all
the Slav contenders swarming in the camp there
were but two with whom they could commune, the
familiar scouts, Salisky and Marovitch.</p>

<p class='c004'>A welcome word then from the latter was the
word “move.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The flight of the aeroplanes from this point,
where Lupkow pass pierced the Carpathians, followed
the Vistula River in that part of its course
which forms the boundary between Austria and
Russia.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was in the little town of Sandomir that the
aviators rested after a continuous flight of 200
miles, and where the pilots met an old friend of the
Przemysl time, none other than Stanislaws, in the
guarded procession north of the defenders of the
late Austrian fortress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri did not hesitate in making a rush
to greet this former comrade of the aerial profession,
and eager to hear of the last days in the surrendered
stronghold.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here you are again, Stanny,” cried the U. S. A.
boy, “and, though the luck has run tough against
you, we can’t help being glad of the chance to see
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Austrian airman for the moment had a look
askance at the green garb of the lads, indicating
Russian service, but he could not long withhold
hearty response to the advances of his young
friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not know you first, you gay turncoats,”
he jovially quizzed, “but it’s a happy break in the
gloom for me, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As for that,” said Billy, touching the green
sleeve of his coat, “we have simply been tossed about
from one to the other of you until the Joseph we
read about could scarcely have worn more colors
on his back. But how did they get to you, Stanny?
I thought the old fort didn’t have a hole in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There was an opening, though, my boy, and
wide enough for famine and fever to crawl through.
That was the combination that got to us first and
there was nothing else to do but to give up. The
rank and file did not know how near the rations
were gone until Breckens, you remember him, was
starting in his aeroplane with distress messages for
Vienna. The Russians shot him down, and he fell
within our line. The situation was then revealed.
Well, my young friends, it is all over, and we have
only one glow ahead—they have promised not to
send us to Siberia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how was it that the aeroplanes could not
bring in enough concentrated foodstuff to keep you
ahead of hunger?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri had recalled the many expeditions in which
Billy and himself had participated to serve that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“An impossible task,” asserted Stanislaws.
“With the rations entirely exhausted, there were
one hundred and twenty thousand mouths to feed
in the garrison alone, and civilian inhabitants, too,
clamoring for food.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must have been awful,” was Henri’s sympathetic
comment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stanislaws passed a hand before his eyes, as if
to shut out the terrible memory.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is there anything we can possibly do for you,
Stanny?” earnestly asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The haggard soldier in faded blue at first gave
the negative by shaking his head. Then he suddenly
asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“By any chance, do you suppose that you will
visit Przemysl in your present routing?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not sure,” replied Billy, “though it is evident
that our scouts started here to get in touch
with the Russian forces whose strength may be
diverted elsewhere, now that the fortress has surrendered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it be so, and you are again privileged to move
at will within the enclosure, there is a favor that
you may safely, I believe, do for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Name it,” urged Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the bastion at the extreme right of the west
rampart of the inner fort is a loose stone, rough-faced,
and marked by powder burn, cross shape.
The stone can be moved with knife blade. Behind
it you will find a moleskin belt, containing a decoration
of great value to me and mine; a ruby-set
sword hilt of far more value to a jeweler; a packet
of letters, and several roleaux of gold. I would
that you could accept the gold without danger,
owing to its place of minting, but otherwise I pledge
you to deliver this belt to the man, Fritz, at the
Steiber Coffee House. Say to him, ‘It is for Eitel,’
and you will have fulfilled your promise.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What if there are no ‘Fritz’ and no ‘Coffee
House’?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy spoke like the critic of a contract.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In that case,” wearily stated Stanislaws, “return
the belt to the place I left it. In no event must
you assume any further risk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t see why you didn’t get away in your
aeroplane when you saw the jig was up. You could
have done it with honor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri could not suppress his regret over this
lost chance on the part of the Austrian.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was officially suggested to me more than
once in the fort just before the storm broke,” said
Stanislaws, “but the idea did not appeal to me. My
duty was to sink or swim with the balance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not remarkable that the boys should be
permitted to hold such lengthy converse with the
prisoner, for as the companions of the noted scouts
from headquarters they roved without hindrance,
and, besides, had not the Muscovite troops themselves,
but a short time previous, cheered the unarmed
Austrians after their parade out of Przemysl?</p>

<p class='c004'>That Salisky and Marovitch finally interrupted
the interview was not a move of official interference,
but due only to the emergency of their travel
plan. The scouts attributed the interest taken by
the lads in the trooper under guard solely to the
fellowship of airmen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All aboard,” hailed Salisky, at sight of the
young pilots; “we must be pushing on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where away?” called Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Ask me no questions, and I’ll tell you no lies,’”
quoted the scout. “But,” he instantly added, good-naturedly,
“we expect to visit some new birds in an
old nest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The inference was plain enough that the aeroplanes
would be headed for the Przemysl fortress,
and the direction taken by order speedily proved it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri did not realize what a shake-up
there had been in and about the stronghold since
their leaving with Roque, until the machines they
were driving hovered over the once familiar
ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>Heaps upon heaps of débris marked all that
remained of the strongest of the outlying forts, which
the Austrians had blown up preparatory to surrender.</p>

<p class='c004'>Only the inner sections and the town itself, the
boys observed, were intact.</p>

<p class='c004'>Over all now the black double-headed Eagle of
Russia—gone the long-resisting garrison of von
Kusmanek.</p>

<p class='c004'>Clearing the trenches and the barbed-wire entanglements,
the pilots volplaned to the old landing
place, where they had first met Stanislaws, the
friend to whom they had just pledged their services
for the only favor they could grant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some changes here, pard,” remarked Billy, as
they looked out and around from the rampart to
which they had climbed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should say,” commented Henri; “I see that all
the bridges are gone, and that pontoon one leading
out of the town, I suppose, was set up by the Russians
immediately after the surrender.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Speaking of the town,” said Billy, “reminds me
that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go over and see
if the Coffee House is yet standing, and if Fritz is
still on his pins.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I expect Fritz has many times tightened his belt
since the picking grew thin, let alone feeding the
public as he used to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, old top, and what of it?” laughed Billy.
“Fritz could buckle up a foot or two and then would
never be mistaken for a fairy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Steiber Coffee house, the boys soon discovered,
was no longer a center of good cheer, bright
fires and sanded floors, but an improvised hospital,
crowded with the sick and wounded. Fritz, however,
was there as large as life, and apparently none
the worse for the horse-meat diet during the weeks
of want and woe in the town.</p>

<p class='c004'>Like Stanislaws, he had an extra look at the
transformed aviators before he began to thaw into
former genial address, a warning process instantly
and wholly completed when Billy sounded in his
ear the words, “It is for Eitel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This friend of many travelers, credited with
speaking knowledge of seven different languages,
probably used a little of all of them in the greeting
inspired by the magic sentence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The same flying boys you are that sat at my fireside
with the Herr Georges” (Roque) “and the
red giant” (Schneider) “on that first dark night
when the great guns were roaring across the river
and you came in with the wind. Ah, how different
now,” sighed the heavyweight host; “the good days
are no more. And,” he concluded, “what of Eitel;
what word of him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri told of the trust imposed in them by Stanislaws,
and of the charge that they deliver to him
(Fritz) the belt and the valuables therein.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He knows, he knows,” murmured the innkeeper,
with eyes moist and a tremor in his voice, “that old
Fritz will find a way to reach his loved ones at
home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The next thing,” asserted the practical Billy, “is
to pass you the trinkets, for we never know when
the call will come to pull out for another station.
Keep a happy thought, old man, until we see you
again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With these parting words the lads sauntered back
toward the fort, with a studied air of careless unconcern.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the time they were figuring on the quickest
way to get to the earthwork where Stanislaws’ treasure
was concealed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX.' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />AN UNEXPECTED ORDER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Within the fortress enclosure the boys took
their bearings from memory and soon stood in the
shadow of the west wall, in the location described
by Stanislaws. They could see a sentry moving
with measured tread on the narrow walk above
them, and waited until he passed beyond the turret
in the first turn of the circular parapet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy led the way in setting foot on the elevation,
with Henri close at his heels. In quick step they
were within the angles of the bastion, and Billy
took a peep along the wall to see if the sentinel had
commenced his backward beat. But the guard was
taking it leisurely, for no armed foe was known to
be lurking without, and the duty of patrol this
evening was a matter of military form.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri in the meantime had been casting about
for the loose stone marked by the cross-shaped powder
burn.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had evidently found it, for Billy heard a
whispered request for the loan of his knife.</p>

<p class='c004'>Inserting the blade in the thin line where the mortar
had crumbled, Henri dexterously twisted the
stone out of its socket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is here all right,” he said, holding up the belt
for the inspection of his chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy, as a matter of precaution, replaced the
stone and smoothed away with his foot the earth
particles which had fallen with the knife chiseling.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the guard finally approached, the belt was
safely tucked away in Henri’s blouse, and both of
the innocents were idly leaning over the parapet,
apparently viewing the activity in the Russ encampment,
across the San river.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Slav soldier challenged the intruders in his
own language, but in answer the boys simply shook
their heads, indicating lack of understanding.</p>

<p class='c004'>Looking downward, the guard hailed a number
of Cossacks engaged in some lance-tilting game in
the stone square.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Dons surrounded the boys the minute they
descended to the level, and failing to get satisfaction
in their jerky string of questions, began to pull and
haul the captives in a roughly sportive way.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys vigorously protested, but to no avail,
and Billy even resorted to a real kick or two at savage
shins. In the scuffle it so happened that the
amulet which Nikita had given Henri fell out of the
torn front of his blouse and under the feet of the
tormentors.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sight of the thonged lance-point had magic
effect. The Cossacks ceased their badgering as
one man quitting. The Don in authority had lifted
a hand high above his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Henri stooped to recover the flint talisman,
the chief anticipated him, presenting it with a grave
salutation to the bewildered lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>It dawned then upon the aviators that they had
been recognized as “brothers of the blood.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri turned an “I told you so” glance at his
chum. That “useful in a pinch” prediction had been
verified in most opportune manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>Salisky and Marovitch had no honor as a rescue
party when they later arrived in the enclosure, completing
a hurried search for their pilots, who had
failed to report for the evening distribution of rations.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the scouts could have exacted the credit of
being a surprise, or, rather, surprised party when
they plumped upon the seated group of Cossacks
dividing the contents of their knapsacks with two
youthful recruits occupying the center space at the
feast.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By my sainted ancestors,” exclaimed Salisky,
“look at the lion tamers!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was careful, however, to say it in other than
the native tongue.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Been looking for us?” asked Billy in the most
innocent way imaginable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, we are just trotting about for our health,”
ironically replied Marovitch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better come along, however,” advised Salisky,
suppressing an inclination to laugh, owing to the
presence of the seriously gazing tribesmen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All ready,” cheerfully announced Billy, after
Henri and himself had made a handshaking round
of the circle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Marching away with the scouts, it had been made
up between the chums that the details of their adventure
were strictly private business.</p>

<p class='c004'>While particularly anxious to get Stanislaws’ belt
to Fritz that very night, Henri concluded that the
early morning would do, especially in view of the
fact that Salisky had made no mention of any move
immediately contemplated.</p>

<p class='c004'>It developed, however, that the boy missed his
reckoning, and proving the old saying that “delays
are dangerous.” Hardly an hour of sleep, it seemed
to the boys, had been granted them when the hand
of Salisky dragged the pilots out of slumberland.
In reality, it was cold, gray dawn which accompanied
the awakening process.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Orders to backtrack,” was the brief statement of
the scout, himself already attired for flight, and
with dispatch case swung over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t mean right away?” Henri sat up in
his cot to put the question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just as soon as you can get outside of some
rations,” replied Salisky, “so there is no time for
napping. It is a long ways to Warsaw and only two
stations for food and fuel in between.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you didn’t say a thing to us about it last
night,” argued Henri, greatly disturbed by the prospect
of failure to fulfill their pledge to Stanislaws.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come out of your dream, boys; it is not like you
to question orders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The scout stood by while the boys prepared for
the journey, and they were never alone again in this
last hour in Przemysl.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stanislaws’ belt weighed like a chunk of lead
against the heart of Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Salisky had stated, the aviators had but two
brief rest periods in the flight to Warsaw, and they
traveled at lightning speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the end of this air voyage, the aviation chief
peremptorily ordered them off duty for at least two
weeks. “No use of killing these birds,” he said to
Salisky, with a chuckle, “when you have taken all
the fat off their bones.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In their old quarters that first night of their return
to Warsaw from the Galician fortress, Henri
looked about for a safe place to hide Stanislaws’
belt, which not only produced worry of mind but
a positive irritation in the several days’ wearing.
The chums lay awake long after the other aviators
in the dormitory were deep in slumber, and cudgeled
their brains to invent a way of shifting their new
responsibility to some likely cache for the time being.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy happened to think of the rusty, dusty portrait
of some long departed inmate of the house,
hanging just outside the door which opened on the
stair landing.</p>

<p class='c004'>He transferred the thought into Henri’s ear, and
the pair cautiously tiptoed across the room, taking
advantage of the intermittent shafts of light sifting
through the tall windows nearest the lamppost at
the street corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee whiz!” muttered Billy, halting in momentary
anguish, after stubbing his toe against a chair
leg.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ssh!” sibilantly warned Henri; “you’ll wake
the dead with your clatter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Noiselessly drawing back the door, the boys stood
under the iron-framed likeness of the early day
representative of the household, Henri holding the
moleskin girdle in the crook of his arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy did the squirrel act in mounting the newel
post, and could easily reach behind the picture. His
chum passed up the belt, and the climber hooked
the brass buckle over the wooden peg from which
the portrait was suspended.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Safe enough now,” he whispered, sliding down
from his perch, getting a helping arm from Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>Five minutes later the young aviators were sleeping
the sleep of the satisfied.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX.' class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />HUNTING FOR TROUBLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The sun was ten o’clock high when Billy hoisted
himself with his elbows and realized that Henri and
himself had been singularly favored by the usually
exacting aviation chief, who tolerated no lazybones
around quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hi there, sleepy head,” he called to his chum,
who was still drawing long breath through a wide-open
mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold your peace,” growled Henri, turning for
another snooze.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Billy, now wide awake, and in frolicsome
mood, had his comrade out of bed by the heels, and
it was not until they had knocked over about everything
in the room that they desisted from their
riotous wrestling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blame your gaiety,” panted Henri; “why
couldn’t you let a fellow rest?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’d be a Rip Van Winkle if you had half a
show,” guyed Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>In more serious turn the boys went out to look
at the picture above the stair landing, to see if any
telltale strap of the concealed belt was showing.
Nothing, however, to betray their secret to the curious
eye was in evidence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A good job for a dark night,” observed Billy,
going down the stairway, two steps at a time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All the grub gone?” he inquired of Corporal
Romeroff, on mess duty.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter grinned, and showed the boys two well-filled
platters on a near-by table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The chief is a first-rate boss,” was the enthusiastic
expression of Henri, between attacks on the
provisions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“None better,” admitted Billy, sitting back from
the table, with a sigh of repletion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the program for to-day?” queried Henri,
“seeing that we are freelances for a while?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve just been thinking that I’d like to know
for sure whether or not Ricker got out of town.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say, Buddy,” broke in Henri, “I don’t believe
we had better toy with that buzz-saw again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only a bit of scouting, old pal,” wheedled Billy,
“a sort of look over and not in. I confess that my
bump of curiosity is not growing less as I grow
older.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, well, let it go at that,” agreed Henri, with
an air of resignation. “Maybe it wasn’t intended
that we should live long enough to wear carpet-slippers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys strolled to the square of the memorial
column, and halted at a point directly opposite the
shop of the silversmith. The front of the establishment
was sealed by closed shutters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Evidently nobody at home,” said Billy; “and,
really,” he added, “I didn’t expect there would be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you know but what the old fox is still
in his den and not using the front entrance?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I were guessing,” replied Billy, “it would be
that Ricker has long since crossed the river. Yet
I wouldn’t mind finding out for certain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There it is,” commented Henri; “I knew you
wouldn’t be satisfied to let well enough alone. Come
on, then; let’s look in the alligator’s throat to see if
he has teeth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Easy now, pard,” chided Billy; “there is nothing
rash in my mind at this moment. If a little
closer view doesn’t serve the purpose we will just
be ladies and ask a policeman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Crossing the street, the lads tried the shop door.
It stood as tight as wax.</p>

<p class='c004'>A passerby tried to tell the boys something, but
gave it up in despair when they looked as blank as
a person stone deaf.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why didn’t you add the Slavonic to your language
list, young man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy shook his finger at Henri in mock severity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve no room to call me down in that regard,”
retorted the French boy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“True enough, pal,” apologized Billy; “it’s only
a case of two babes in the woods in Russia instead
of one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Between the silversmith’s shop and the next adjoining
building, a warehouse, apparently deserted,
was a narrow, covered walk, running back and the
full apparent length of both structures.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy, evidently forgetting his original determination
not to cross the line of discretion, started to explore
this cul-de-sac, this passage open only at one
end.</p>

<p class='c004'>His chum accepted the inevitable and doubled up
with the leader.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s an even bet that we will be yanked up for
attempted burglary,” he gloomily predicted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s about the point, I think,” mused Billy,
“where we lay behind that revolving door; that is,
providing we were now inside.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what of it?” impatiently demanded Henri.
“We certainly don’t intend to break in to prove
your deduction.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy had no response for this. He was curiously
examining a postern, or door, in the wall cutting off
the vaulted passage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wonder if there is a combination to this thing?”
He put the question to the test, closely inspecting
every panel in the door from top to bottom.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Old thumbs up surely had a way of getting
through from this side,” continued the Bangor boy,
“and it was not by key, either—no sign of a keyhole
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The mechanician in Henri was aroused. The
door puzzle was something in his particular line.
With no less interest now than that displayed by
his comrade, the expert began tapping up and down
the solid surface with the haft of his pocket-knife.</p>

<p class='c004'>Directly he turned a bright eye and a complacent
smile upon the interested Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing to it at all, Buddy,” he advised, putting
his hand on one of the little iron plates that studded
the doorway in two rows from jamb to hinges.
“The hollow is behind this one. See?” Henri
illustrated by thumb pressure on the edge of the
metal disc, which turned upward, exposing to view
a steel ring slightly more than finger size.</p>

<p class='c004'>Without waiting for further demonstration, Billy
promptly tried a pull on the hoop in the hole. It
was lost motion, for the ring had no forward give
to it. An experimental push, also, was without result.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Turn it,” was Henri’s rather impatient suggestion.</p>

<p class='c004'>That was the trick that drew the bolt. The boys
heard the click of the hidden spring, and so sudden
was the giving of the barrier that Billy, using an
arm prop against it, went in like a diver. The recoil
was equally speedy, and Henri saved himself a shutout
by using his foot as a preventing wedge.</p>

<p class='c004'>With both boys inside, the postern closed behind
them without a sound. The passage here was so
narrow that it enforced single file proceedings. At
the right was the wall of the silversmith’s shop,
to the left the barred windows of the warehouse.
The structures might have been houses of the dead
for all the signs of occupancy then shown.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was uncertain in his mind as to the first
tackle of the mystery that he had conjured to while
away an idle hour. He was not particularly anxious
to run afoul of Ricker and his hairy retainer.
Indeed, had he glimpsed the heads of either of them
in window or doorway it would have been back to
the square for him, and if there was any talking
to be done, that conversation would have to be exchanged
in the open.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was just that bump of curiosity, of which
Henri had more than once jokingly said “could only
be reduced by a smash with a sandbag.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy’s conclusion favored further exploration of
the vaulted walk, which no doubt had been originally
designed simply as an air shaft, and later converted
to some other use. It was the latter supposition
that appealed to the would-be explorer.</p>

<p class='c004'>With continued progress between the walls, the
boys marked gradual descent, becoming more pronounced
at every step. Then the path curved
abruptly and ended at the base of a tower-like brick
chimney, built outside of the warehouse wall and
making the first opening in the hitherto overlapping
cornices of the buildings running parallel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The silversmith’s shop is considerable of a bluff
when you come to compare the known front with
the unknown rear,” remarked Billy, who had been
mentally figuring the distance from street to postern,
and from postern to this chimney obstruction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It has just occurred to me that Ricker must have
been in charge of the whole block. The way it
looks, all the rest around here have marched off to
war.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri had no proof up to the minute that the
warehouse was or ever had been a hive of industry.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come here, pal,” called Billy, who had stepped
from the front to the side of the chimney base; “I
believe there’s a way to get to the basement of this
old shack.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His discovery was a rusty grating set in the floor
close to the foot of the chimney, and it was surprising
how easily it could be moved.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For our special convenience,” chuckled the Bangor
boy, when he noted a number of iron spikes
protruding from the masonry in order for descent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The same sort of fire escape arrangement runs
up the chimney; didn’t you notice?” asked Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that’s for the lookout, pard; I tell you this
is a bully plant in which to prowl. But let’s go below
now and aloft later.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was already legging it, spike to spike, into
the depths of the old warehouse.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“What a place for a ghost dance,” commented
Billy, peering into the shadowy beyond, as he
waited for Henri to join him in the big cellar.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri, letting go the last hand-hold, immediately
announced that the briefer the stay here the better
it would suit him. “Trot along, Billy,” he urged,
“and get it over with.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had passed under several arches in half-seeing
endeavor to locate a way to the floor above,
when Billy came to a quick halt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought I heard voices!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re likely to hear anything in this catacomb,”
replied Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, it isn’t nerves, Buddy; it’s talking. Listen!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads, standing mute and with ears attuned to
acute pitch, were soon impressed with the fact that
there was a mumbling medley of conversation somewhere
about, but whether at hand or more remote
they could not decide.</p>

<p class='c004'>So in tremor and doubt they moved with less
haste, and stopping at intervals to analyze every
suspicious sound. But now it was only their own
breathing and footfalls that disturbed the tomb-like
stillness.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the bottom steps of a broad flight of stairs,
which they had finally located, to their great relief,
the boys made resolve that the first opening at the
top that presented itself, offering opportunity of
escape from the building, would not be neglected
for the space of even a half minute.</p>

<p class='c004'>The excitement of breaking in had now no show
with the desire to break out.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the top of the stairway the climbers saw before
them an immense platform, very likely the
place of loading, for several trucks in advanced
state of disuse were here and there in view.</p>

<p class='c004'>But what most interested the lads was a clearly
outlined path, through the heavily settled dust,
stretching across and beyond the platform, and
leading to a door of white pine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I expect the voices we heard belonged to the
same parties who made this trail,” was Billy’s low-toned
opinion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whoever they belonged to,” softly observed
Henri, “I prefer to give them the benefit of the
doubt, and if there is a window handy, opening on
the good old outside, it’s me for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m with you this time, Buddy,” promptly
agreed the Bangor boy; “I’ve had my full of this
expedition, and ready to play quits.”</p>

<p class='c004'>If Henri had anything further to say, it did not
reach utterance, for quite distinctly now the lads
could hear in varying strain the muffled intonation
that had at first startled them in their stumble
through the lower regions beneath.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stealthily skirting the platform, the boys took
to their knees in the dust, with their eyes on a
level with the raised flooring, at a point immediately
to the right of the big door.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had been their intention to make their way past
the door to the first turn of the counting room enclosure,
which they were sure would set them going
in the direction of the street flanking the west side
of Memorial Square.</p>

<p class='c004'>Off the platform they were afforded better opportunity
for quick concealment in case any of the
mysterious inmates of the supposedly deserted
warehouse should suddenly appear on the higher
plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the near point of hiding the boys got a new
idea of the center plan of the working floor, as
adapted to the business for which it had been designed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The counting house was arranged like a deck
cabin of a ship, open space all around, a fact not
apparent to the boys when they first emerged from
the cellar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a cinch,” whispered Billy, “that we can get
by on one side or the other if we haven’t forgotten
how to do the Indian crawl.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it wasn’t for that talk buzz,” asserted Henri,
“I’d be inclined to tell the neighbors that the old
plant was as empty as a last year’s bird nest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not to mention the tracks on the platform,”
reminded Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No definite telling when those marks might have
been made,” continued Henri, “and as I was saying,
the talkfest mystery is the one absolute assurance
that we are not alone in these diggings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the passing,” intimated Billy, “there may be
a crack in that hut in which an eye would fit, and
there is no use leaving an unsolved problem behind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri grinned. “I’ve been expecting that,
Buddy,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alongside the counting house the boys moved on
all fours, and it did not take Billy long to find a
place to put his eye. Just over his head was the
checking window—a small aperture, masked by a
curtain of green baize, from which projected a
rounded shelf. There had been a warp between
this projection and the window setting, and through
the open seam a free view of the enclosure was presented.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Billy had completed his look-in, he resorted
to the sign language as a means of conveying the
word that the room was occupied. Henri, surmising
as much from the fragments of conversation
sifting through the loose lines of the wooden wall,
took his turn as an observer.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the same rough garb of coal heaver that he
wore on the day of delivery to the young aviators
of the summons to the twin towers, Ricker was
lolling on a rickety bench, and another man equally
shabby in makeup was perched upon a dingy counter.
On the floor at their feet, gagged and bound
hand and foot, was the heavyweight policeman, who
had officially invoked the services of the silversmith
as an expert examiner of the battered remains of
the time clock dug out of the ruins of the explosion-rent
military storehouse.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker had occasion to several times admonish
his companion for getting too high a pitch in his
rumbling voice. These vocal lifts at intervals, no
doubt, were the sounds that had from the first convinced
the boys of the presence of other life than
theirs in the building.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This carrion,” Ricker was saying, prodding the
prostrate officer with the toe of a hobnailed boot,
“is too much of a blunderhead to kill outright, and
it would be a shame to deprive the rats of such a
splendid spread of live meat. But, after all, seeing
that the game is up here as far as I am concerned,
I will let the palace of justice keep their numbskull.
There’s a lout that will let them know in
twenty-four hours after we are gone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man on the floor spluttered in his gag and
strained at his bonds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Heigho, Casper,” yawned Ricker, rising and
stretching himself, “it’s soon farewell to Warsaw
for us; we were good citizens, eh, Casper? We
leave our mark, too—and we will also leave that
crazy Hamar if he does not show his ugly face
within the next ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricker consulted a heavy gold watch, which he
produced from the folds of his woollen shirt. Two
gunny-sacks, bulging at both ends and roped in the
middle, might have furnished evidence that the silversmith
was taking most of his stock with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys, taking turn about at the look-in point,
concluded to sheer off for the time being, when
Ricker bestowed a parting kick upon the trussed
policeman, shouldered the gunny-sacks and started
for the door of the counting house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose Hamar will know where to find us?”
questioned the man called Casper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blast him for a crank, there is no telling anything
about him,” fumed Ricker; “he had the hour
pounded into his addled brain, and it is nobody’s
fault but his own if he misses fire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri were prepared for the sport of
hide and seek, until they could learn the direction
that Ricker and his companion proposed to take.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each took a corner of the counting house at the
rear, and each on the alert to work the disappearing
act.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />AN EXHIBIT OF NERVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Ricker and his companion, however, took a
route that relieved the wary watchers of the necessity
of doing lively footwork to keep out of sight.
The path followed was that across the platform toward
the top of the stairway descending to the
basement. Through the opening there the pair disappeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first thought then with the boys was to immediately
release the prisoner in the counting house
from his uncomfortable predicament, but a second
thought made this preceding one for debate.
Through no fault of their own, and, unconsciously,
the lads had been indirectly connected with recent
Warsaw operations of Ricker, and to be well rid of
him was a matter of self-protection. Having
squared themselves with the Cossack, Nikita, the
passing of the silversmith would be a final clearance
of old scores.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s give them an hour’s leeway, and then we’ll
cut his nobs loose,” suggested Henri; “the chap in
there would start something mighty quick the minute
he got on his feet, and there’s no telling what
might be coming to us if Ricker was brought to bay.
He’d surely think we had betrayed him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and come to think of it, as we did before,
the authorities here might not accept graciously our
plea of innocence. We’d get it both going and coming.
Plenty of time to untie the policeman. He
ought to be thankful that it is only one hour instead
of twenty-four, and maybe a good sight longer than
that, if we did not interfere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy’s conclusion would have stood as satisfactory
but for a startling development of the instant.
Some intuitive process of the mind caused him to
cast a glance over his shoulder, and within twenty
feet of him, coming with cat-like tread from the
far front of the warehouse, was the threatening
shape of Hamar. It is doubtful if the hairy henchman
of Ricker was then aware of the presence of
the boys, and if he had any special purpose for
carrying an unsheathed knife in his hand, the reason
must be accounted for in the person of the unfortunate
policeman on the counting house floor.
Hamar was of the fiery brand of conspirator who
resented any application of law, and woe to the man
who affronted him. The poisoned ring episode was
an instance in point.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri, gazing in another direction, for the moment,
was wholly oblivious of the new peril at hand
until apprised by a hiss from Billy. Half turning,
the French boy was looking full into the malignant
face of the velvet-footed oncomer.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a side leap that covered several feet, Henri
dashed around the cabin, meeting his chum, who
had jumped on the other side, at the front entrance,
both crossing the threshold at one step, and banging
the door behind them. Billy grabbed at the bolt
just over the latch, and sent it with a snap into its
socket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee whillikens,” he panted, “that was some
acrobatic act!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The door creaked and cracked with the outside
pressure that a powerful and infuriated man was
exerting against it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys hastily dragged forward the several
heavy benches in the room and stacked them up
for an additional and supporting barrier.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next move was to free the policeman, who,
though carrying a lot of surplus flesh, would apparently
make a fair bid as a full hand in a fight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Relieved of the gag, what the officer had to say
about his late captors was red-hot Russian. When
Henri had severed, with his pocket-knife, the last
strand of the confining cord, the big policeman regained
his feet with astonishing alacrity for such a
heavyweight. He speedily worked the stiffness
out of his joints by swinging his arms about like a
windmill and vigorously stamping up and down
the few feet of floor space.</p>

<p class='c004'>Shrewdly surmising that his rescuers were not
conversant with the native tongue, he asked in
French: “How many of them out there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The door was rattling ominously, and one of
the hinges gave way with a scattering of screw fastenings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One,” answered Henri, “but he’s a corker—the
fellow with the hair mattress around his ears.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, oh,” exclaimed the policeman, “I gave him
a rap with my stick before they downed me. He’s
of strange breed, not like the rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The thought came to both Billy and Henri that
Hamar was here to exact blood atonement for the
mentioned blow.</p>

<p class='c004'>The policeman wrenched a heavy oak brace from
one of the benches, tested its heft by a long arm
swing over his head, and grimly remarked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“This will drop him if he comes through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The door gave way with a crash, the piled up
benches toppling with the impact, and on top of
the whole mass the tiger man with dagger drawn.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before the fierce intruder could recover his balance,
the policeman with bench brace poised for
action brought the oaken weapon down with terrific
force on the raised right arm of Hamar, a muscle-numbing
stroke, which relaxed the latter’s grip on
the haft of the glittering blade and sent it spinning
under the counter across the room. A second blow
cut into his forehead.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men grappled, swayed to and fro in interlocked
fury, rolled over the fallen door and out
upon the platform. Hamar was at a disadvantage
by reason of the blinding effect of blood from the
forehead wound, and it was evident that he was
seeking to break away from his burly antagonist.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri, wildly excited over the fray,
danced around the combatants, narrowly escaping
at times a bruising jab from whirling heels.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fight ranged closer and closer to the head
of the basement stairway, the plain intent of the
policeman’s hairy adversary.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here it was, by some cunning wrestler’s trick,
that Hamar broke the hold of the heavyweight,
bounded through the opening and down the stairs
with an agility that baffled interference.</p>

<p class='c004'>The policeman, though winded by exertion, did
not delay pursuit, and he was not far behind his
wily foe when the latter paused for a second as
though hesitating over the course to take.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys, in the immediate wake of the doughty
officer, saw that the fugitive was making the run
back in the same direction that they had followed
in coming. Speeding along with the policeman,
their judgment as to this was verified in the passing
under an arch out of which several large stones had
fallen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s making for the chimney grating,” advised
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The policeman, under ordinary conditions, might
have yielded to detective instinct and asked the boy
how he knew so much, but this was no time for
cross-examination by him, racing through a cellar
after a fight for life, and in eager pursuit of a desperate
and dangerous enemy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hamar had climbed the spikes to the chimney
base, and by the time the policeman got his head
through the grating was shinning up the big smokestack
like a monkey.</p>

<p class='c004'>The trio in the rear swarmed up the handholds
in close pursuit, the fat officer puffing and growling
at every reach.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the wide expanse of the warehouse roof
could be seen, quite near, the channel of the Vistula
river. Hamar had reached the extreme west line
of the elevation, and was looking down into the void
that effectually blocked further flight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have him now,” exulted the big policeman,
hurrying forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was not a sure thing, after all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Directly beneath the coping, over which Hamar
was leaning, rose the rigging of a great crane, the
mighty arm of which was lifting with mechanical
regularity to swing heavily weighted sacks from the
wharf into the hold of a waiting collier.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardly ten feet separated the pursuer and the
pursued, when Hamar bestrode the coping—now
he is over and hanging by his hands—now he drops
into the crane rigging—then crawling out on the
swinging arm, he is swept in wide circle over the
dizzy height—now he slides down the chains, now
astride the sack just hooked—now lowered with the
weight of coal into the vessel!</p>

<p class='c004'>During the exhibit of daring, from the first sight
of the perilous descent on the chains to the final
dump, the stevedores stood aghast and open-mouthed.</p>

<p class='c004'>As for the policeman and the boys, looking out
and down upon the astonishing performance, none
of them had a word to say for several minutes after
it was all over.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee whiz, but wasn’t that the limit?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Billy who broke the breath-holding period.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the policeman awakened from his temporary
trance, he was very much awake.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is still a live chance to nab him,” he exclaimed,
“if we can only get down there before the
collier clears. Once out in the channel and that
fool is liable to drown himself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>If the officer had only known it, the man he
most wanted, and upon whose head was the far
greater price, even now was a stowaway in the very
ship into which Hamar had been tumbled.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />FOILED BY A FALL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Such was the haste of the officer to get to
ground that he started down the spike row in the
chimney regardless of the fact that a slip for him
might spell dire consequence. It was not exactly
a slip, however, that actually brought him to grief,
but the outpulling of one of the big nails, owing to
the drag of unusual weight, and resulting in about
a twenty-foot fall. Had it not been for the assumed
leadership of the ponderous policeman,
either or both of the boys who might have immediately
preceded him would either or both probably
have ceased to take any further interest in the
doings of earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy, next in the line of descent, almost took a
drop himself, when he heard the gasp of alarm and
the thud of the heavyweight on the stone pavement below.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fallen man was unconscious when the boys
reached his side, and blood was flowing in thin
streams from his nostrils. He groaned when an attempt
was made by Henri to raise his head for pillowing
on the boy’s coat, which he had removed
for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One of us had better go for help right away,”
suggested Billy, “and I guess it will be me, for you
are better on the nursing part of the job.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With the utterance the self-elected seeker for
aid ran at a lively clip up the passage toward the
street front.</p>

<p class='c004'>The runner was hardly through the spring-locked
door before Henri, left behind as nurse,
noted in his patient signs of returning consciousness.
Indeed, the policeman had opened his eyes
and was staring at his attendant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where am I?” he hoarsely questioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will remember it yourself in a minute or
two,” cheerfully replied Henri. “Take a brace,
cap., and you’ll be going again like a top before the
supper bell rings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now I have it,” cried the victim of the jarring
fall; “we were just closing in on that wild man
when he jumped onto the derrick. Why are we not
at the wharf to stop that boat?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take it easy, cap.,” cajoled Henri; “you’ve had
a bit of a tumble, but you’ll be there on time. Don’t
worry.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The policeman raised himself on his elbows, fired
by a spirit averse to delay, twisted himself about,
and succeeded in making a back rest against the
chimney.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What has become of the other boy?” was his
next inquiry.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gone for a doctor or anybody else that he can
pick up in a pinch,” advised Henri. “But you can
see for yourself—here he comes now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was accompanied by a tall, slender man with
a clean-shaven face, swinging a leather case in his
hand in the usual professional way, and indicating
readiness for any surgical or remedial emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bringing up the rear were two policemen in uniform
and a short-legged apothecary from the nearest
drug store.</p>

<p class='c004'>The company entire sounded a note of recognition
when they saw the injured man sitting at the
foot of the chimney base.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strogoff, by my soul,” ejaculated the doctor;
“this young messenger said that a policeman had
been hurt, but I had no reckoning that it was the
fighting sergeant of headquarters staff. Let me
have a look at you, man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah,” he said, after quick examination, “a little
concussion, that is about the extent of it; no bones
broken; lucky, sergeant, that you were so well-cushioned
by nature, and good feeding, I might add.
You will be sore from this shake-up, but far from
the hospital, my dear sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here, give me a hand,” broke in the sergeant,
addressing the officers standing behind the physician.
“Now,” he continued, stiffly rising with the
assistance rendered, “I want the pair of you to use
your legs to best gait and give order of detention
to the master of the wharf back of these buildings,
to hold at all hazards the collier there loading.
Go!”</p>

<p class='c004'>With the doctor’s arm aid on one side and the
druggist’s on the other, the sergeant was led, slowly
and limping, out to the street.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hailing a hack, passing through the square, Strogoff,
aided by vigorous boosting, climbed in and
motioned the boys to follow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Drive like the devil around to the river front,”
he commanded the reinsman on the box, and the
way the vehicle rattled over the pavement showed
that the officer inside was not considered the kind
of individual with which to trifle.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the sergeant reached the wharf, a big
transport occupied the offing, upon which troops
were embarking, and small mountains of military
supplies also being loaded with all possible dispatch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff’s brother officers, who had been sent in
advance to the wharf, had made no progress in
their mission, owing to the martial preemption of
the premises, and the sergeant’s attempt at argument
with the irate lieutenant-colonel directing the
getaway proceedings fell upon deaf ears.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not until the transport was in mid-channel
and swiftly steaming up the river that the wharf
master could be reached.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sergeant, for the time being, had no regard
for his aching head and back, and with renewed
vigor was on the trail of the suspect who had given
him the slip on the warehouse roof. “You saw
the way that ape got into the coal boat, didn’t you?”
was the first interrogation fired at the wharf master.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not blind,” responded the official addressed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has the collier cleared yet?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, and it will not until morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This last answer to his questioning set the sergeant
up in confidence that he would be soon dragging
Hamar out of a dust pit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The vessel which he was seeking was readily located,
out at anchor, by an obliging stevedore, and
the three officers, accompanied by our boys, reached
the hulk in the wharf master’s launch.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was in the deepening dusk that the searching
party went aboard of the dingy craft, and the skipper
was inclined to be surly until the rays from the
mainmast lantern were reflected in the shining
badges of authority on the breasts of two of the
officers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s wanted?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A fugitive from justice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff’s declaration was snappy. He did not
approve of the sullen attitude of the skipper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will call the crew; you can choose your man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The rascal I am after came on board with a
sack of coal this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That oaf,” sneered the shipper, “have him hide
and hair for all of me. Druski, ho, Druski,” he
called.</p>

<p class='c004'>From between the decks slouched the brawny
mate of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Druski,” repeated the skipper, “is the dolt still
below?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” answered the mate; “I kicked him, along
with two hiding heavers, out of the bunkers two
hours ago, just before the transport forced us to
move. One of the heavers carried a good lot of
dunnage over his shoulder, but he did not steal it
here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Another sailor just at the moment came over
the side, completing shore leave. “While you are
asking, sir,” he stated to the skipper, “I saw the
three of them go aboard the transport. A matey
with me on the wharf said the big bark was short-handed
in the engine room, and anybody with a
pair of shoulders was liable to be nabbed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three of them!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The big sergeant made a bee-line for the informer.
He reeled off a minute description of
Ricker.</p>

<p class='c004'>Looking to the skipper for permission to speak,
and getting a nod, the sailor expressed the view
that one of the three might fit the illustration if he
were dressed differently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One net for them all,” almost shouted Strogoff,
“and in the stew they will make a pretty kettle
of fish. Look alive; into the launch with you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The little steamer was showing all its lights, fore
and aft, as it hummed through the pitchy darkness,
heading straight for the wharf.</p>

<p class='c004'>Piling into the hack the five were driven furiously
to police headquarters—there is no speed
limit in Warsaw—where the sergeant reported the
situation in brief to his long-headed superior in
the inner circle of surveillance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Show me the way to catch the transport,” declared
Strogoff, bringing his knuckles down with a
bang on the table, “and I will show you the spy
who blew up the storehouse!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The chief was on his feet in an instant. “Telephone
the shipping bureau,” he sharply ordered, as
a desk man responded to an insistent buzz signal,
“and ascertain if a high-speed dispatch boat is available
for immediate service.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Five minutes had elapsed when the desk man reappeared.
“Sorry, sir,” he said, saluting, “but
numbers four, seven and nine, the only fast travelers
retained here, are to-night somewhere near
Plock, and are not due to return inside of six hours.
No other steam vessels in harbor but the slow colliers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ask them, then,” impatiently commanded the
chief, “if the transport can be reached by wire this
side of Vloclavek?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Another wait of several minutes. Again the
voice at the door:</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, sir; the vessel has no wireless apparatus,
and the first land station is Vloclavek.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Might as well be Siberia,” lamented the
sergeant; “those foxes will be off the boat long before
the land telegraph can spot them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The chief made no reply. He was wrapped in
meditation, with lowering brow and thin lips compressed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then his eyes lifted and his entire expression
changed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is nothing on land or sea, sergeant,” he
triumphantly asserted, “that can outspeed an aeroplane.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />AGAIN ON THE WING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Sergeant Strogoff’s elation over the solution
of the pursuit problem was manifested by a sounding
slap on his knee, forgetting that it was the leg
most bruised by his recent fall, and his beaming
face was comically twisted by a wince of pain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have at them, chief!” he cried. “But we must
appeal to the military authorities for the airships,
and the experts to guide them. With your permission,
sir, I will put the emergency to Colonel Malinkoff
this very hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The chief, undisturbed, checked this proposition
of hasty action with a gesture of dissent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Daylight will do for that, sergeant, and a few
hours more or less will not matter. With sixty or
seventy miles an hour as our advantage, there is
no question as to the outcome of the chase.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The cold-gray eye of the chief, lighting upon the
boys, standing with Strogoff’s comrades near the
door, he imperiously demanded:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are these new recruits in your service, sergeant?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bless me, sir,” quickly responded the officer addressed;
“let me tell you that if it had not been
for them I might have been filling an uncovered
grave to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Put it all in your report, sergeant. You had
better be eating and sleeping while I prepare a statement
that will induce the military branch to act
and aid promptly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The summons for the chief’s secretary was
sounding when the sergeant and his young companions
left the office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think a half hour in the chop house around
the corner will be good medicine to start with,” remarked
the big officer, who was a famous feeder,
and who had missed several meals since his hold-up
in the rear of the silversmith’s shop.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the continuous run of excitement following
their discovery of Strogoff trussed up on the counting
house floor in the old warehouse the policeman
had never made a single inquiry as to the boys’
identity. If he had noticed them on the day they
were posing as would-be customers in the shop of
the silversmith, and when he served summons on
Ricker to appear as an expert witness, there had
been no sign of the fact.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Billy said, in an aside to his chum, “He thinks,
maybe, that we dropped out of the sky just to help
him out of a scrape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff, having gorged himself with a mammoth
beefsteak flanked by onions, and the boys fully
satisfied with their own prowess at table, the trio
hied themselves back to police headquarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Andreas,” said the sergeant to the desk man,
“we are going to take a snooze in the rest room,
and if the chief wants me never stop shaking until
you get my eyes open. And, what is more, do not
come too soon if you can help it, but by the powers
do not come too late if you know it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The desk man grinned and nodded understanding.
Three hours later he fell like a fire alarm on
the snoring officer, and as the latter rubbed the
sleep out of his eyes, handed him an envelope, sealed
with red wax. It was addressed to Colonel Malinkoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was in the gray dawn that the sergeant and
the boys set out for army headquarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stopped by a sentry, Strogoff displayed his badge
and also produced the letter from the police chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were passed without further question, and
found the colonel, ever an early riser, preparing for
breakfast. Such was the bulk of the policeman that
the boys in line behind him were completely hidden
from view.</p>

<p class='c004'>Opening the envelope, Colonel Malinkoff noted
the contents, penciled a few words on the margin,
and instantly remarking:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Request granted forthwith. Orderly,” turning
to a soldier in the room, “go with this officer to
aviation quarters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As Strogoff stepped aside, that the aide might
lead, the colonel saw the boys.</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Pon my word, young men, you are early visitors.
What has gone wrong with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Much to the astonishment of the policeman, the
colonel extended a welcoming hand to each of the
youngsters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know them, colonel?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rather well acquainted,” laughed Malinkoff.
“Hope you have not arrested them, officer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not me,” stoutly declared the sergeant; “I owe
them my life. But may I tell about that later, colonel?
Time presses.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Malinkoff waved consent, and a few minutes later
Strogoff handed the letter and order to the aviation
chief, with the presentation, saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it pleases you, sir, we would ask the services
of aviators who can go the route with the greatest
skill and speed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is a pair of them behind you this minute,”
was the quick answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff simply stared at the youths, who now
stepped forward to salute their chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What next?” The question was in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The arrangement was that two biplanes were to
go, it being deemed essential that there be carried
one observer vested with the authority of the military
branch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Walki was assigned to the duty, and to
the biplane which Henri was to pilot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am the boy with the ballast,” joked Billy,
when he learned that Strogoff was to ride behind
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you think for a second that he is entirely
new as an air passenger,” quietly advised the aviation
chief, who had heard Billy’s facetious remark;
“several times to my knowledge, and for hours at
a time, he has leaned over the side of a speeding
aeroplane, watching city roofs for contraband wireless
apparatus.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Within twenty minutes after the order had been
presented by Strogoff, such is the efficiency and
expedition of all proceedings with which trained soldiers
have to do, the aviation party were off in swift
and unerring pursuit of the transport, now many
miles away churning against the current of the
river Vistula.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the open country near Gombin, having encountered
a fierce gale which whirled them out of the
line of the river course, the aviators decided to
alight, and wait for a lull in the storm.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though chafing at the delay, Strogoff wholly
agreed with Captain Walki that possible overstraining
of the rigging and mechanism of the aircraft
was something that must be avoided.</p>

<p class='c004'>As it was, Billy and Henri had their hands full
in repairing some damage already done.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You boys wear a couple of level heads,” admiringly
commented the big policeman, when landing
was made; “there is more ventilation aloft this
morning than I have ever experienced, but perhaps
you are used to it—at least it did not seem to bother
you much.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it had, Mr. Strogoff,” jollied Billy, “you
might have been spread all over the ground by
this time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Shortly after the noon hour the high wind
shifted, and when flight was resumed the gusty
force was behind the biplanes, which served to increase
their speed to a tremendous degree.</p>

<p class='c004'>Notwithstanding this, however, the long stop had
served to vastly increase the lead of the transport,
which had never ceased to plow ahead by the impulse
of its powerful propellers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The vessel was steaming into Vloclavek harbor
when the onrushing biplanes neared this port.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the time the aviators could reach the ground,
the ship was at anchor, with many small boats plying
about her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Walki immediately approached one of
the ship’s officers, who was standing on the quay,
and explained the situation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There was quite a number shoveling below as
we came up,” said the official addressed, “and the
only thing to do is to go on board and look them
over. There’s a gig at your service.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff was the first in the proffered boat, and
the rowers that manned it did not pull any too fast
to suit him.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a file of soldiers the searching party went
below, but among all the smutty-faced, stripped-to-the-waist
workers in the furnace room the men
wanted could not be found. No more successful
was the further and thorough search made in every
conceivable hiding place on upper and lower decks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Duped again,” raged Strogoff. “What is your
opinion, captain?” he appealed to Walki.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Walki, who had been fully advised of
the clue which had caused the pursuit of the transport,
reflectively stroked his short beard and laconically
remarked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think the sailor on the collier lied!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />THE SERGEANT’S VOW.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Do you know what I believe, Buddy,” said Billy
to his chum, while they were having a little quiet
discussion of their own about the way Strogoff had
been misled; “I believe, sure and certain, that it was
a phony crew on the collier—not a man jack of
them regularly on the job.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Report at once, pard, and get your badge,”
laughingly urged Henri. “Why don’t you tell it to
the sergeant?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not taking any chance of getting on his toes
just now,” was Billy’s reply, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff, though somewhat crestfallen over the
collapse of his eagerly conceived plan to put the
irons on the adroit Ricker and the lesser lights with
him, had lost none of the bulldog tenacity of purpose
which characterized his every movement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will yet put every last one of them against
the wall,” he earnestly vowed; “the chief by this
time has received my wire, and that coal boat will
be a marked craft wherever it goes. Strange,
though,” he continued, “that the skipper should
have been so indifferent as to inspection, when he
well knew what he would get if caught at deception.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy tipped a significant wink to Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sergeant, having obtained positive assurance
that no man unaccounted for had either boarded or
left the transport from start to finish of its passage,
agreed to the proposal of Captain Walki to immediately
return to Warsaw, and there frame a new
course of action.</p>

<p class='c004'>With clearing sky and no countering winds, the
young pilots made the most of the remaining hours
of daylight, and there was safe landing in Warsaw
while the night was yet young.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff’s reception at police headquarters was
not such as rejoiced his soul—the chief had a piece
of news for him that had stunning effect.</p>

<p class='c004'>The regular master and crew of the collier, No.
49 in the shipping record, the very vessel upon
which the sergeant had been hoodwinked, were
even now still in the slow recovery stage from
drugging. Only the night before the whole seven,
captain, mate, engineer and deck men, had been
found deep asleep in a dinghy, drifting about the
harbor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You seem to be losing your grip, Strogoff,”
snapped the chief in that steely voice of his.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sergeant hung his head for a minute, and
then, advancing, looked his chief straight in the
eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For every inch I have gained in unearthing the
spy den in our midst, sir, I have risked again and
again that precious possession called life, and while
I may have proved for the once a dull blade against
overly keen ones, it is no sign that I am through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well, Strogoff,” hedged the chief, “they
have had a fall out of you; that cannot be denied,
but, perhaps, after all, you are not through. The
credit of locating the nest is still yours, and you
shall have a free hand to complete the work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you kindly, sir;” there was renewed
vigor in the tone and manner of the sergeant; “may
I ask what became of the coal boat that was in the
offing when I left?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With the discovery of the stupefied sailors, and
their identity established, the harbor patrols were
put to work, but no trace of the vessel was found
along the city front.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No question, then, sir, but that she immediately
weighed anchor and made off down stream—it was
not up, I assure you, for I had my glass on the
river from the time we started from Vloclavek.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was the theory upon which we acted, sergeant;
two dispatch boats have already taken up
the chase.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And me not in the forefront,” cried Strogoff,
sounding a note of disappointment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You still have the aeroplane route,” suggested
the chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sergeant brightened at this. “But no use of
a blind run,” he sighed; “in the dark we might
overrun a dozen boats like the collier, and never
know it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get your boy wonders and start as soon as you
can see, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is just what I will do, chief, and I would
like to have Lowiez assigned with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just the man, if there is any fancy shooting to
be done,” agreed the chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It might come to that,” grimly observed Strogoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>At sunup the Young Aeroplane Scouts had their
second early call within three days.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We haven’t signed up with the police for the
league season, have we?” inquired Billy, with a
slight touch of rebellion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They have the colonel’s orders back of their request,”
explained the aviation chief, “and the officer
with the wide front positively declares that nobody
will suit but the pair I see before me. Climb
out, boys, and hustle, or he is likely to have a fit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some lively vacation this, eh, Billy?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy did not catch Henri’s remark, for he was
over ears in a basin of ice-cold water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had intended to take a peep behind the picture
and see if the belt is there all right,” said Billy, as
they passed out of the mess hall in the direction of
the hangars.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No need,” replied his chum; “nobody ever
touches that wall relic, and Stanny’s girdle is safe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri’s new flying partner, Lowiez, was of
swarthy type, and with the keenest pair of black
eyes the boy had ever seen over a human nose. The
outside pockets of his greatcoat bulged with the
heft of two heavy revolvers, and if the carrier
should have shown a hesitancy in using them, if occasion
served, a surprise would be coming to any
person who had sized them up.</p>

<p class='c004'>It might also be stated that Officer Strogoff, with
all his cares and strenuous activities, had lost no
flesh overnight.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviators had not been given any advance
notice of just where this day’s journey was
expected to take them; they only knew that there
was to be a beginning. The end was not until
they reached it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff was not inclined to be bubbling with information,
either, this crisp morning. Following
the boys’ usual careful inspection of the flying machines,
the startling words were simply: “Down
the river.” Additional orders were to fly low.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having no trouble to compass a course, merely
to follow the flow of the broad Vistula, the pilots
were completely at ease. Under them were the famous
No. 3’s, the finest military biplanes, in their
opinion, that ever crossed the country.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the current below could be seen at intervals all
sorts of steam and sailing craft, iron-sided or slab-sided,
modern and ancient, but the space-filling observer
in Billy’s biplane, with constant level of field
glasses, had no disposition to waste a word upon
any of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>A certain slow-moving tub, with “49” showing
at the beam, would have caused lung expansion for
the heavyweight, but that particular brand of boat
had yet to be discovered.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was 10:20 o’clock by Billy’s watch when a
smart tap on the shoulder roused him from some
day dream of far-off Bangor or Boston, and made
him set a little tighter grip on the steering wheel.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the junction of the Vistula and one of the
numerous smaller rivers emptying into the big channel,
several little dispatch boats were chugging
around a large freighter, plowing northward. The
hulk was easing its way at the challenge of the
mosquito fleet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To the ground,” commanded the sergeant, when
he had secured the attention of the pilot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy nicely figured a stop on the river bank
within a stone’s throw of the watercraft argument.
Henri followed suit with equal exactness of placing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Megaphoning through the hollow of his joined
hands, Strogoff brought one of the light draught
dispatch boats close to the shore.</p>

<p class='c004'>A gangplank bridged the way to the deck, and
the big policeman lumbered aboard in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the row?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer in command of the boat, detailed
from the river patrol, explained to Strogoff that
before passing the mouths of any of the tributary
rivers in the course down, they had been holding
up each and every north-bound vessel for the purpose
of inquiry. In every instance but this one of
the freighter, Collier No. 49 had been reported.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My opinion, sergeant, is that right here the coal
tub dodged out of this channel. The master of the
freighter has not spoken a single craft of collier
build below this point.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff thought a minute. “I am not going to
put all of my eggs in one basket this time,” he finally
observed, “no matter how fair the quotations. Two
of your boats may proceed, and two are to follow
me up this tributary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Leaving to the officer addressed the duty of arranging
details of the plan, the sergeant regained
the river bank and advised the pilots of the new
course of the biplanes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardly twenty-five miles had been traversed,
when the aviation party, even as one man, caught
sight of a hull at a dead standstill in the sluggish
stream. The bow of the big boat listed in a way to
suggest that it had been stranded on a sand or mud
bar. There was no sign of life on her decks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff shouted an order to descend, and the
pilots circled in prompt endeavor to land as near
as possible to the apparent derelict. No chance
whatever for a deck fall on this old hunker with its
topside barrier of crowding masts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once on the ground, Strogoff and Lowiez cast
about for a way to reach the vessel, bow-ended in an
extensive marsh between the shore and river channel.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not long before Lowiez discovered in the
drift, a hundred yards or so downstream, one of
the ship’s boats, by means of which, no doubt, the
bogus crew had landed from the stolen craft. The
hulk had been instantly identified at closer range as
the collier sought for—“49” showing at the stern.</p>

<p class='c004'>If either of the policemen feared ambush on the
hunker, it was not apparent in their manner of proceeding,
except that Lowiez, the pronounced “fancy
shot,” kept both hands in his overcoat pockets while
the stout sergeant volunteered to pole the skiff out
to the stranded collier.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri watched them from a perch on
a pile of driftwood.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t see to save my neck,” observed the
Bangor boy, “why that Ricker crowd, with all their
daring and cunning, didn’t paint a new number on
the collier, change the papers to suit, and bluff their
way nearer to the Austrian border before they
shook the ship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For the reason,” argued Henri, “that the live-brained
leader counted upon aeroplane pursuit and
no chance in the world to escape capture on the
open waterway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s something in that, come to think of it,”
admitted Billy, “but there is also some pretty hard
sledding ahead of them in the bleak country back
of us,” indicating by an overshoulder look at the
great barrens stretching away to the horizon.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All the more room to hide,” observed Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And to starve and freeze,” added his chum.</p>

<p class='c004'>They could see the two policemen moving about
the upper deck of the collier, but the fact that their
search was soundless made it plain to the watchers
that it was a sure thing that the hull had been deserted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now in the distance could be heard the chug, chug
of the fast-coming dispatch boats.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they finally drew alongside the stranded vessel,
Strogoff and his comrade lowered themselves
by the side chains to the deck of the first comer,
which then turned toward the shore.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys were wondering what the next move
would be.</p>

<p class='c004'>The answer was embodied in a pair of long, sinuous
shapes, tawny-hided and slather-jawed, sleepily
stretched full length in the cuddyhouse of the little
craft.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fugitives were to be trailed across the steppes
by Siberian bloodhounds!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br />LOST ON THE FROZEN STEPPES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Yelping and tugging at leash, the hounds were
given the scent at the shore point where the ship’s
boat had been found. It was decided to let them
run free, and to follow the fierce trailers in the
biplanes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus it was that Henri was compelled to take on
an extra passenger in his machine, no other than
the handler of the dogs, who alone could be depended
upon to bring the animals to heel if the men
pursued should be brought to bay. As luck would
have it, the additional weight was that of a little
man, who could have been wrapped twice, and some
over, in Strogoff’s coat.</p>

<p class='c004'>All three of the officers were armed to the teeth
with modern repeating rifles, taken from the supply
on the dispatch boats, and supremely confident
of their ability to cope with the estimated small
party, however desperate, which they expected to
encounter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dogs, too, were allies that would make a
goodly showing if it came to a clash in close quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviators had been impressed by the
sergeant that their business was solely that of pilots.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let anything happen to you,” he said, “and my
day of self-forgiving would never come. Besides,
I am now accountable to Colonel Malinkoff for your
safety on the ground, the same as you are responsible
for mine when you get me on high. Understand?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We get you, sergeant,” was Billy’s reply; “you
have our promise not to butt into any shindy where
we are not invited.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Turn them loose,” was the sergeant’s order to
the little man, who was struggling to restrain the
leaping hounds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two streaks of brown and yellow flashed across
the plain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All aboard!” shouted Strogoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a scramble into the biplanes, and a
lightning-like getaway.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hounds were already far afield, but nothing
on two feet or four, on wheel or keel, can stay
ahead of an aeroplane, and the scampering animals
were overhauled in a jiffy, and the pilots holding
to low speed to even up the chase.</p>

<p class='c004'>Along a marshy stretch of ground the dogs
seemed at fault, going at zigzag, but ever returning
to the spot where first the scent was lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little man, crouching behind Henri in the
biplane, requested the pilot to descend forthwith,
and as it was simply a ’round and ’round operation
to keep in sight of the baffled hounds, there was
really nothing else to do but stop.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy had already anticipated the situation, and
had started to volplane even before his chum had
set the planes for landing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The master of the hounds, whom Strogoff addressed
as Petro, was forced to literally drag his
canine charges away from their persistent adherence
to the one spot on the high side of the marsh.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lowiez, he of the keen eye, had been doing some
scrutinizing on his own account, and read an explanation
by certain marks on the flinty ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>Addressing the sergeant, he briefly disposed of
the puzzle:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Horses here not long since; the men we have
been trailing went no further on foot. That is
why these beasts are out of the running.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cossacks, I’ll be bound,” exclaimed Strogoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>“On that theory, sergeant,” continued Lowiez,
“we have two surmises, one that the band was on
the way to the nearest army command, and the other
that they were free riders and traveling as the wind
listeth. In either event, does our service extend so
far?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The arm of the Russian police system,” proudly
declared Strogoff, “has no limit within the realm of
the Czar. And, too, our special mission is backed
by both civil and military authority.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As you will,” conceded Lowiez; “it is needless
to state that I am with you to the death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning to Petro, the sergeant said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“As the dogs can no longer be of use, and as it
is practically impossible to safely carry them in the
aircraft, I must bid you back with them to the dispatch
boats, which had orders to await, for a period
of three days, our return.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Without comment, the master of hounds faced
about and started on his long march, with the dogs
capering at his heels.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we have a roving commission now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff had his field glasses glued to his eyes,
and taking in the range of open country. The powerful
binnacle, however, showed him nothing of interest.
It was a dreary outlook at best.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fly east, fly west, fly south,” he repeated—“a
choice broad enough for an empire maker. It is
well that we know what is behind us. Are we prepared
for a longer journey, my pilot?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can easily do three hundred miles with our
petrol supply,” assured Billy, who had just completed
inspection of the tanks in both machines.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are two days’ rations in the lockers,” volunteered
Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So far, so good,” commented Strogoff; “there
is no use standing here cooling our heels. Let’s be
off!”</p>

<p class='c004'>For three hours the aviation party was continuously
on the wing, traveling a southwesterly course,
a trying experience owing to the frigid atmosphere
and the cramped position maintained.</p>

<p class='c004'>Toward evening another stop was in order. A
bivouac must be established for the night. The
aviators had been hoping against hope that a settlement
would be reached, where, at least, the privilege
of a shakedown before a peat fire would be
accorded.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a bitter disappointment to Strogoff that
fortune had not favored him in these long hours
of vigilant outlook with a sight or sign of the horsemen
he was pursuing. Almost a monomania with
him was that one overwhelming desire to lay his
hands upon the arch-plotter Ricker.</p>

<p class='c004'>The truth was, he had no fixed idea when to
quit, and now was so far beyond his reckoning that
he did not know how to back out.</p>

<p class='c004'>When that night the weary four sat huddled together
and blanketed to the ears on the frozen plain,
Lowiez, who since his first venture and rebuke had
offered no remonstrance, suggested that the early
morning ought to see them well on the way to the
Vistula, and then homeward bound.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We won’t get anywhere, sergeant,” asserted
Billy, upholding Lowiez, “if we wait until the
petrol’s all gone—and another day without filling,
that will be exactly the condition.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have it over, then, as you will. If you know
the way, take it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff had spoken, and resignedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they slept, or how long, none of the party
could have told, at first awakening. Their disturbance
it was that filled the full measure of mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was picked for the initial shock. He opened
his eyes against the nose of a horse! That a Cossack
was looking at him from higher up did not
serve, either, to reduce his pulse rate.</p>

<p class='c004'>A prod with a lance put Henri in the line of sitting
up and taking notice, and similar applications
hastened wakefulness on the part of both Strogoff
and Lowiez.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Filimonoff!”</p>

<p class='c004'>This cry of recognition from Lowiez.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the greatest of all Cossacks—Michail
Filimonoff, of whom the boys had heard so much
in Galicia—the man “who sits his horse like a
Petrograd bank clerk, but leads like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Don chieftain, a little to the rear and apart
from the other horsemen, gravely inclined his head,
when convinced by the uniform that the speaker was
a fellow countryman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff, too, had once seen the noted free lancer
at the staff headquarters of Duke Nicholas, and
he followed the lead of his comrade in proclaiming
the name.</p>

<p class='c004'>He then stepped forward to address the Cossack
leader, telling him in a torrent of words how and
why he had come to grief as a lost man in these
frozen steppes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Filimonoff shook his head. “None of this company,”
he gravely advised, “has seen those whom
you seek. It may have been Nikita, who rode this
way, I am told, not long since. But I did not meet
him, and I do not know that he had prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Out of the chief’s address the boys singled the
word “Nikita.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell him,” requested Billy, looking to Strogoff,
“that Nikita took us into the brotherhood.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sergeant turned a gaze of anxiety upon the
young aviator, as if in fear that his mind had been
affected by overstrain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell him,” repeated the boy, in form of earnest
demand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strogoff then complied, but in apologetic manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the big policeman had any further doubt of
the propriety of his statement as interpreter it did
not stay with him long.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri capped the climax by a joint display
of the amulets they carried, and every lance
in the Cossack company was raised, including that
of the leader.</p>

<p class='c004'>Filimonoff beckoned the boys to his side, having
dismounted to give them greeting.</p>

<p class='c004'>Said Strogoff to Lowiez:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The next thing we know those lads will be taking
lunch with Duke Nicholas. They started in on
familiar terms with a commanding officer at Warsaw
the second day I knew them, and have already
worked on through to a prince of the desert!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But by the grace of it all, the pilots were given
their bearings and carried the policemen passengers
out of the barren maze.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />A FREAK OF FATE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>One afternoon, a few days subsequent to their
return from the last air voyage with Strogoff, and
while the boys were engaged in making repairs and
generally overhauling the No. 3’s, who should appear
on the aviation grounds but the selfsame sergeant
wearing a brand-new uniform and a profoundly
long face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not really know,” he said, drawing closer
to the young aviators, “why I should want to tell
you anything about the latest jolt I have received in
connection with that Ricker deal, but as you were
in the game from first to last, it just seems as
though you have a right to share in all the details,
though it sort of rubs it in on myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the news, sergeant; give it to us
straight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy’s bump of curiosity was apparently incurable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither that prince of rascals, Ricker, nor any
of his lieutenants were in the party that gave us
the slip on the plain. One of our ‘quiet friends’ in
the Bzura river region has just reported the presence
there of the one-time silversmith, another of
the spies we know as Casper, and the Tartar crank,
blast his whiskers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who then ran off with the collier?” inquired
Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is where I am still guessing,” continued
the sergeant, “but I am letting the Cossacks take
care of them. No doubt they were bought, body
and breeches, and delivered the goods by putting
the marked men across the Vistula.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why didn’t you nip Ricker at the outset?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never suspected him until the time the clock
was found in the fallen walls of the storehouse,
and he failed to report with it for investigation.
The whole affair had been charged up against the
men who jumped from St. Michael terrace into the
river.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was about to state that he knew all about
Strogoff’s official visits to the silversmith’s shop,
but it suddenly occurred that the least he said the
safer for Henri and himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My first bad break,” asserted Strogoff, “was
the night I went alone to that den to take Ricker
into custody. I had handled, I thought, worse than
he. But I got a biff from the rear with a sand-bag—and
you know the rest. I will have to admit,”
he concluded, “that for once in my life, at least, I
have been bested all around.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys might have told the Warsaw sleuth
that they were acquainted with a secret service
worker called Roque, who was even a slyer fox than
any the big policeman had ever encountered—but,
of course, they did not tell him anything of the
kind.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviation chief was responsible for a break-up
of this review of recent adventures, when he called
to the young aviators to report immediately at
headquarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hastily laying aside the tools with which they
had been working on the aircraft, the boys instantly
responded to the summons of their chief, while
Strogoff started on his way downtown.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are booked to pilot a couple of old friends
of yours in another flight to Petrograd,” announced
the boss airman; “that is if you are ready to resign
from the police force.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was smiling when he submitted the last proviso.</p>

<p class='c004'>The “old friends” were the scouts Salisky and
Marovitch, who had just sent another pair of tired
aviators to the rest ward, after a gruelling trip
along the firing line in the southwest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you up to snuff, my laddybucks?” was Salisky’s
jovial greeting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the pink of condition, Brother-never-wear-out,”
gaily rejoined Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“None of your duke’s palace entertainments this
time,” broke in the other iron man, Marovitch.</p>

<p class='c004'>In destiny had been indelibly written a certain
happening that would be, and was, and in the great
capital city of the Russians resulted in the translation
of our boys into an entirely new sphere of action.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the pilots set out on the familiar route without
other thought than that, if no unforeseen peril
of aeroplaning intervened, they would slide again
into these grounds in the same old way. The scouts
had orders to return within three days, if it were
by consent of the powers that be at Petrograd.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the biplanes had winged their way along
the flow of the Neva to the fixed point for the
flight’s finish, there was goodly margin on the right
side of the time limit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more the young pilots climbed the marble
steps of Admiralty Place, preceded by the veteran
scouts and special messengers—this time, however,
without encountering in the imposing interior any
former fierce foe in parti-colored uniform. By the
blood ceremony elected to the Cossack brotherhood,
the boys could now look without tremor into the
somber eyes of each and every knight of the desert
in imperial service that they might pass in the wide
and high corridors.</p>

<p class='c004'>But as none of the Dons with whom to exchange
the high sign happened to be about, Billy and Henri
soon wearied of the waiting assignment on the outside
of carved and brass-knobbed doors. They
flatly informed Salisky that this part of the contract
belonged to himself and Marovitch, and if the
scouts did not consent to letting their pilots go out
and knock around for a while it would certainly
result in two clear cases of St. Vitus dance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get along with you, then,” ordered Salisky,
with a grin, “but, mind what I say, you are not
to leave the immediate vicinity, and must return
within the next two hours. There is no telling at
what o’clock we may be called upon to sail out of
here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Talk to the winds, old scout, the boys were on
the way to the open before you had turned the last
period.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a glorious afternoon on the great Nevskoi
Prospekt, the magnificent street overflowing with
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s more people out on runners here than
I ever saw before in one procession,” observed
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Doesn’t look as though all the fine horses were
stopping bullets on the battlefields.”</p>

<p class='c004'>If Henri had not early gone into training as an
aviator, he could easily have passed muster as a
premium giver in an equine show.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They couldn’t drive ’em like this through the
streets of Boston,” further commented the U. S. A.
boy. “Patrolman Maguire of the traffic squad
would have a picnic on this avenue.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hark! What tumult this in the block beyond—this
mad haste of fur-muffled reinsmen to guide toward
the curb lines—these shrill cries of warning!</p>

<p class='c004'>A pair of splendid Orloff stallions, black as Erebus,
red nostrils agape, foam-flecked, raising, with
the frantic pounding of their iron-shod hoofs, upshooting
fountains of ice and snow particles, were
running a frenzied course directly towards the spot
where our boys had been viewing the unceasing
sweep of sleighs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Behind the maddened animals, swaying and now
and again skimming sidewise on one runner, and as
often lifted clear of the ground, was a sledge of
swan-like outline, from which trailed the dragging
ends of furry robes.</p>

<p class='c004'>As in the span of a clock-tick the young aviators
had sight of a child clinging to the high back of
the sleigh, a little girl, her hood fallen and twisted
over shoulder, and her bright crown of curls tangling
about her set, white face.</p>

<p class='c004'>With every nerve tense, and as if strung on one
wire, Billy and Henri had a second to think, and
in the next time flash to act.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the passing the sleigh swung dangerously close
to the curb, upon which the lads were poised for a
spring at the wildly careening conveyance.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the opportunity, the boys leaped together—Billy
went sprawling into the pile of furs in the
bowl of the vehicle, while Henri had a close call
in getting aboard at all, just managing to grasp the
hand-curve of the rear seat, and his knees were
sweeping the street surface for twenty or thirty
feet before he attained foothold on the runners.</p>

<p class='c004'>The U. S. A. boy leaned far out of the bed of the
sleigh, with lowered hands, striving to reach the
trailing reins, whipping about in the wake of the
racing steeds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two men ahead tried for the curb bits of the
high-checked horses, but were hurled aside like
featherweights. Billy had a fleeting glance at one
of the brave fellows, lying quite still, face down,
in the street.</p>

<p class='c004'>The width of the avenue—about 150 feet—and
its straight length—more than five miles—had so
far afforded a fighting chance of escaping death-dealing
collision.</p>

<p class='c004'>The action in this saving venture of our boys
cannot be followed in its rapidity by the telling of
it. When Billy found, with a grab or two, that the
reaching of the reins was a long shot, he was up
with a jump and at the scroll-turned front of the
sleigh.</p>

<p class='c004'>The crupper of one of the runaways was at his
hand—this horse was lagging a little. The next instant,
and the boy was clinging to the rein rings
of the top harness and digging his heels into the
heaving flanks of the laboring animal. Working
forward with the same celerity, Billy got a hand-twist
on the reins where they doubled to the bit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sawing for dear life, he forced the horse’s jaws
with the killing curb—but then it was that the free
running steed swerved into the path of its mate, and
the team went down in a crashing mix-up.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Bangor boy was catapulted forward, clear
of the thrashing hoofs, yet with a falling force that
jarred him into oblivion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />A NEW ASSIGNMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When Billy regained his senses he found himself
in a clean, enameled white bed, and was conscious
of a black silk sleeve with snowy cuff when a deft
hand tenderly adjusted a bandage that lay damp
upon his aching forehead. These little details were
impressive in the way of assurance to the patient
that he had awakened this side of the grave.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where’s Henri?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The nurse made no reply to this first question
from the bed, except the mute expression of putting
a finger to her lips, enjoining silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I say, nurse, I mustn’t be wasting time here;
my chum and I have a flying contract on hand, and
this very minute ought to be sticking around that
big building down the street.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Getting more and more impatient, Billy essayed
a sitting posture, but the effort forced a groan. At
this the attendant hastened to settle the boy in comfortable
position.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must be quiet, monsieur,” she softly admonished
in French.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess I’ll have to be,” weakly conceded Billy.
“But can’t you tell me whether or not my pal is all
right? And—that’s so; did the child in the sleigh
come out safe?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one hurt but you,” gently assured the woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bully for so much,” rejoiced the boy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely enough,” murmured the attendant.</p>

<p class='c004'>A portly surgeon entered the room, reached for
the wrist of the patient, and his smiling face indicated
that the case looked good to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Out in a week,” he announced to the nurse.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy did not understand the words, but the manner
was satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c004'>To some whispered inquiry by the nurse, the surgeon
nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-morrow will do,” he advised.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the passing of the surgeon, the nurse told
Billy that he might expect a visit from his comrade
in the morning. “You can be sure,” she added,
“that it has been no easy task to keep him out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The patient grinned. Since he had learned that
Henri had escaped unhurt, he had really wondered
how they had worked it to keep his chum away
from him.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the morning brought Henri, the French
boy was not alone—and the rather boisterous
greeting between the reunited inseparables was witnessed
by a tall, broad-shouldered man of most distinguished
bearing and a beautiful child with a shower
of bright curls over her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the presence of the important visitor the surgeon
and the nurse were all deference, and eager
to give information that would interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the tall stranger then had eyes for no other
than the boy propped up among the pillows of the
hospital bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My brave lad,” he said, leaning over the boy
with the bandaged head, and lifting Billy’s hand
from the coverlet, “what I might say would poorly
express my gratitude and admiration for your
heroic action. Fredonia, my daughter, would add
her tribute of heartfelt thanks to mine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The child shyly extended her hand, which Billy
touched as he would a flower.</p>

<p class='c004'>With an arm over the shoulders of Henri, the
tall man amended the initial address by saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What I most desire now is to have both of you
in the service at Odessa, that I may have opportunity
to advance your interests and in some substantial
way emphasize my grateful appreciation of
your splendidly courageous action on behalf of my
child.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But we are already spoken for in Warsaw,” intimated
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man smiled as he quietly remarked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps they may not speak louder than Sergius.
Until you have mended, then, my lad, we
will await final decision.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When the surgeon had bowed these interesting
visitors to the door, he briskly returned to the bedside,
and put Billy in possession of some facts regarding
the gentleman whose high favor the boys
had won.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A master of money, my lads,” declared the doctor,
“and allied with the most powerful elements
of the empire, of blood rank most high, and none
the less a prince of finance for all that. He ought
to know what is in the war chest, for he has wonderfully
helped to fill it. To Odessa with Sergius?
Thank your lucky stars, lads, for the chance. He
has airships without rest at his command, as well
as the other kind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The surgeon had been told by Henri that aviation
was the profession of both his chum and himself,
and so in exploiting the opportunities open
to the boys through their new acquaintance he naturally
laid stress on the aircraft inducement.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the doorway now appeared Salisky and
Marovitch who within the hour had been apprised of the
exact whereabouts of their pilots, and having also
earlier learned of the thrilling scene on the Prospekt,
in which their young friends had been the
principal actors.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come alive, son, but it is good to see you with
your head still on your shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The greeting by Salisky, though on the surface
of the lighter vein, had nevertheless an undertone
of deep feeling. That the veteran scouts were
greatly attached to these boys was a fact not open
to argument.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will be wanting somebody soon to drive
you home, old top,” cried Billy, evidencing his
pleasure at the sight of the hardy observers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two flyers of the Admiralty corps have already
been detailed to take us back, and we start in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing slow about the way you are replacing
us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was inclined to be a little piqued at this
ready acceptance of new service on the part of the
scouts, though he was well aware that he would be
in no condition to take his turn at the wheel within
the prescribed time limit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Salisky leaned toward the boy, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The truth of it is, if you do not already know it,
that your next move is not of our choosing. Your
assignment to Warsaw has been cancelled, and your
custody, if it might be called that, has been transferred
to another center of operation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The result of a long reach,” supplemented
Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just so,” concluded Salisky. “Good-bye, my
young friends; luck be it that some day we may
meet again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The speaker turned away without another word,
and Marovitch was equally brief in his farewell.
Both of the scouts, strange to state, were seized
with a joint spell of coughing as they passed out.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, let’s have a bit of a confab all by ourselves,”
invited Billy, “before the nurse fires you.
Tell me what happened after I took the count in
front of those black space-killers?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When you started that circus act on the horse’s
back,” narrated Henri, “I was hanging on by my
eyebrows. Then I managed to get a leg inside the
sleigh and had rolled over on the pile of robes;
then a sudden stop as the sleigh bumped into the
fallen horses—so sudden that my head cracked the
dashboard. You sure found the combination in the
nick of time, with an open drawbridge less than
twenty yards ahead. While about a dozen men were
sitting on the heads of those flopping beasts, who
should come galloping up on a big gray horse but the
little girl’s father, and they had a time together, for
a minute or two, I tell you. When we picked you
up, limp and bleeding, I prayed like a good fellow
that you would open your eyes and say ‘All right,
pard.’ The prince, duke, or count, I didn’t know
which, had you in a carriage in a brace of shakes,
and you have been here ever since, with me hanging
around like a lost soul.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where was the driver of the runaways all this
time? How did they get away from him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was a stickler for details.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh,” continued Henri, “all I know about that is
hearsay; the rig was in front of a palace up the way,
the little one waiting for her father to come out.
The moujik, or driver, was standing at the horses’
heads when a passing auto blew up a tire. The fellow
in front of the wild ones that you pulled down
counted for as much as a piece of paper string.
They left him in the road. That’s how we got into
it. There’s one thing more, Buddy, believe me—those
Sergius horses are not city broke; they’re
too nervous for even a joy ride.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The nurse came in on the talk about this time and
banished Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>A week later, when Billy was himself again, the
boys, so long accustomed to the plain fare, and
often no fare, the hardships, the makeshifts, the
discomforts and dangers of military campaigning,
began to believe that they had hitched up with another
Monte Cristo. Nothing was too good for
them in the well-ordered train of Sergius.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we don’t get out of here pretty soon,” declared
Billy, “we will be afraid to sit near an open
window on account of the draught!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here was a pair not built for coddling.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the days of ease were slipping into the scroll
of time. It was not intended that the flying boys
should too long linger in the lap of luxury. Their
patron had another side to his make-up, and that
was adamant and of boundless determination.</p>

<p class='c004'>The call of the Black Sea was in the air—there
was plenty of powder burning in and about those
strange waters, and another belligerent nation involved,
the like of which the young aviators had
never before encountered during their varied experiences
in the great war zone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />A CRUCIAL TEST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Strong winds were raising clouds of chalky dust
over the great seaport when the boys caught their
first glimpse of Odessa, the terraced city, rising
nearly 200 feet above the level of the surrounding
steppes. By all manner of conveyance, by land or
water, but ever in continuous motion, the Sergius
party made remarkable progress from Petrograd to
the borders of the Black Sea. Behind the expedition
was that power which, as Billy observed,
“makes the wheels go ’round.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The last leg of the journey landed the travelers
at the basins of the mighty rivers Dnieper and
Dniester, upon which floated fleets of Sergius’ ships,
and more of the same vessels controlled by the master
of money lay in the two harbors of the Bay
of Odessa. These latter the boys viewed from the
head of the superb flight of steps descending from
the central square, adorned with a statue of Richelieu,
to the sea. On the chief embankment was the
magnificent residence of Sergius, fronted by a fine
promenade.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some mixture in this town,” remarked Henri,
marking movement in Odessa streets, through
which they were passing—Great Russians, Little
Russians, French, Jews, Italians, Greeks, Roumanians,
Servians, Bulgarians, Tartars, Armenians,
Lazes, Georgians, and so forth, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Turk in his fighting clothes, however, was
an acquaintance the young aviators had yet to make—the
time drawing nigh, though, and a veritable
storm of explosives to make the occasion memorable.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri were to work with the Black Sea
air fleet, their expert services as a contribution from
Sergius, which made them, in a sense, independent
factors as pilots.</p>

<p class='c004'>As untried recruits, and on account of their
youth, the boys had the usual doubt on the part of
aviation chiefs to overcome—and, based upon past
experience, it is perfectly safe to anticipate that they
passed the crucial test, literally speaking, with “flying
colors.”</p>

<p class='c004'>While the lads regretted that they would not have
the No. 3’s under them in their trial trip, all types
approaching the same lines looked alike to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>With two noted aerialists and high-range bomb-throwers,
Lieutenants Moppa and Atlass, behind
them, within three days after their arrival in
Odessa, the newly assigned pilots set out in two specially
designed seaplanes for scout duty that would
take them far across the waste of waters.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bombardment of Novorossisk was in progress
as the aviators sped that way, and the pilots
were compelled to run at great altitude to clear
the mass of flames that lit the lowering sky for
miles around. German gunners in Turkish warships
had shot a hundred oil tanks into blazes. At
Poti another Turkish cruiser was exchanging shells
for the shore pepper of machine guns, and cannon
were thundering from the fortress of Sevastopol.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Moppa, from the aircraft Billy was
driving, sent down a couple of bombs on the Turkish
battleship “Midirli,” but the missiles missed and
splashed into the sea far to the right of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c004'>A couple of marine riflemen took a chance at the
seaplane in return, and more than one bullet flattened
against the armored bottom and side of the
big flyer. The observer seemed to revel in the game,
and shouted defiance at the air, for with the hum
of the motors the biggest voice for distance counted
no more than a penny whistle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer at the rear of Henri, however, made
himself heard by the pilot, when directing attention
to a cloud of smoke lifting high above the lower
strata of mist, and urging speed in that direction.
It was a Russian fleet hastening from its bombardment
of Turkish Trebizond to give battle to the
Ottoman disturbers of the Russian coast line—“two,
three, four, five, six, seven,” counted the aviators—all
of them big ships, and five smaller ones
completing the naval procession.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the two Turkish vessels, five miles away, the
oncomers plugged big shells at a lively rate, and
about the craft under fire the aviators could see
that the water jumped and churned and rose in columns.
To port and starboard, fore and aft, above
and below, there was nothing but shot and shell.
It looked like the Turks did not know which way
to turn, but by some hook or crook they got things
to running smoothly, and made a clean getaway.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mist curtain had grown so dense that the
aerial bomb-throwers did little execution, in their
turn, and soon abandoned pursuit of the fleeing
cruisers, pushing hard for the Turkish coast.</p>

<p class='c004'>The seaplanes settled in the path of the rapidly
approaching Russians, and Billy and Henri rested
after their introductory dash along a new line of
strenuous endeavor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy turned to Lieutenant Moppa, with the inquiry:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did everything work all right?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As far as you are concerned,” promptly advised
the officer, “it could not have been better managed.
I was a little off, though, in the matter of landing
bombs in the right place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The observer with Henri had just told the lad
that he was engaged for life.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Russian warships, among which they were
drifting, the boys learned, were in the Slav naval
movement to approach the strait of Bosphorus from
the north, and related to mighty effort of the allied
forces to pound their way through the Dardanelles
on the other side—that the fleets of all three powers
might shell Constantinople from two directions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we get through the Bosphorus, and I am
wagering we will,” said Lieutenant Moppa as the
seaplanes, side by side, gently undulated with the
waves, “it will be the first hostile fleet that has done
the trick for more than four centuries.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be getting by some 120 guns, I have
heard,” remarked the brother officer, “and they are
pretty near all Krupps, shooting irons not in the toy
class.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I remember once reading a five-cent tear-me-up
entitled ‘The Bride of the Bosphorus; or, the Fourteen
Corpses of the Caspian Sea,’ and if the passage
is as exciting as that story, count me in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This an aside from Billy to Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>While the boys were having a quiet chuckle to
themselves, the flagship of the fleet showed signal to
forge ahead, and the pilots of the seaplanes went to
work again.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a night journey ahead, but with many
searchlights sweeping both sea and sky, it was not
a blind-going proposition.</p>

<p class='c004'>The naval program included an issue with Fort
Killis, about six miles from the entrance of the
Bosphorus, where the Turks had a battery of 6-inch
Krupp guns.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was up to the aeroplanists to look over the situation
in advance, with additional responsibility of
keeping themselves well out of the range of the big
shooting irons, one straight aim of which would
bring the lofty sailing party a very chilly trip clear to
the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the early morning the seaplanes quit the
company of the warships to essay the exceedingly perilous
reconnoiter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The battery which the air scouts sought to accurately
locate was constructed in, or, rather, under
a cliff, and flying high and immediately overhead
the observer had scant opportunity to size up the
real strength and range of the masked position. To
win a look worthy of record it was decided to chance
an 80-mile-an-hour spurt across the sea front.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the gunners were a little slower than the aviators,
it was all to the good for the latter—if the reverse,
the Black Sea air fleet would be reduced just
so many.</p>

<p class='c004'>With all the power in the motors applied, the seaplanes
swept by the face of the cliff, the observers
mentally gathering every detail through straining
eyes, and the pilots equally intent in planning the
lightning swerve that would baffle the men from behind
the Krupps.</p>

<p class='c004'>Out and away! One gun belched fire—then another—now
the whole half dozen or more—with
the crack of rifles in between the heavier detonations.</p>

<p class='c004'>The terrific speed, and the skilful manipulation
of the seaplanes that prevented the presentation at
any time of a broadside target, soon safely carried
the daring airmen far out to sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>Reporting to the admiral of the fleet, Lieutenants
Moppa and Atlass presented Billy Barry and Henri
Trouville with such glowing words of commendation
that the lads quit the quarterdeck with very
red faces.</p>

<p class='c004'>An hour later the warships were throwing projectiles
that showered splinters of rock all over the
masked position. The Russian assault upon the
Bosphorus had begun.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br />RUSSIA’S GREATEST AEROPLANE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>There had been a solemn council, lasting several
hours, in the spacious drawing room of the Sergius
palace in Odessa, and the majority of the participants
wore the insignia of preeminent rank in the
Russian navy.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was evident that some momentous question
was in the foreground, and having to do with a
war move of consequence.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the aerodrome, down on the bay front, another
conference was in progress, of no less importance
to those there gathered—aviators all. The
supreme assemblage on the hill had its problems, but
no more intense interest therein than these aerial
experts manifested over the display of the greatest
of all aeroplanes—the Russian “Sikorsky”—just received
for particular use in the Black Sea fleet, the
second of its kind constructed, and in which
achievement of one of his subjects the Czar himself
had been reported as taking personal pride and
keen practical interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first time I ever threw up my hands for anything
that didn’t come out of our factory,” exclaimed
Billy, walking in wonder around the gigantic
aircraft.</p>

<p class='c004'>With its curtained “cabin,” many-windowed
“control house,” searchlight, powerful engines,
steering wheels, projecting bow, “corridor,” and a
proved carrying capacity of seventeen men, this creation
may seem more of imaginative invention than
the actual production of a machine shop.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the “Sikorsky” is a sure thing, and just as
represented in the sight of our boys on the day
they first marveled at its bulk.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had no idea, though, at the moment of an
experience in this huge machine that would set a
capsheaf on their war zone sky-riding.</p>

<p class='c004'>So when Billy and Henri studied in detail the
points of this wonderful craft it was solely by the
prompting of professional enthusiasm and no intent
of going into training to handle it.</p>

<p class='c004'>They noted that the mighty flyer, of biplane type,
was fitted with four German Daimler engines, had
double control, with two steering wheels, while each
of the four engines drove a separate propeller.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The wind would have to hustle to keep up with
that force,” commented Henri, strongly inclined to
the mechanical exhibit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Moppa called attention to the fact that
the craft had also been fitted with floats, “which
about provides for every emergency,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Think of an aeroplane pilot working behind
glass windows; he will feel as stuck up as a chauffeur
in a first-class automobile.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And as high-toned as the steersman of an ocean
liner, pard,” said Henri, adding to Billy’s comparison.</p>

<p class='c004'>The council on the hill in the meantime had
marked a map with a red line—the Bosphorus at
the end of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The warships that the aviators had left shelling
the cliff battery near the entrance of the strait were
to be tremendously reinforced.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great news, men,” announced Lieutenant
Moppa, after perusing a slip of paper handed to
him by a trim sailor who had been serving the war
council as messenger. “Everything that flies has
been ordered into service for convoy duty with the
squadron that sails in the morning. The new airship
will lead the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would not surprise me a bit,” volunteered one
of the soldier-aviators, “to see the new airship
flying over the Bosphorus batteries before we are very
much older, and loaded with bombs, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A prophet has come among us,” laughed Lieutenant
Atlass, “but more power to him if he rings
true, and rings me into the venture.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give another pull to that bell,” suggested Lieutenant
Moppa.</p>

<p class='c004'>The influence of Sergius was in evidence when
assignments to honor places in the new crafts were
made, and the boys found themselves listed among
the pilots who would take turns at the steering
wheels of the mighty “Sikorsky.”</p>

<p class='c004'>However, the recent performance of the young
aviators before Fort Killis, reported in dispatches,
had the effect of reducing any feeling that favoritism
had been wholly responsible for this advancement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Really, it is more than we had any right to expect,”
said Billy, in discussing the selection of the
airmen who were to serve aboard Russia’s greatest
aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suppress your modesty, my boy; it may be that
I have given you a short lease on life by my recommendation,
but in your work you take the chances
anyhow, so I put you in the way of dying at the top
of the profession.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was the voice of Sergius, half serious and half
in the lighter vein.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had stepped quietly into the air station, and
was contemplating with interest the lines of the new
wonder of the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Already experts were at work within the enclosed
rigging, oiling and polishing the machinery, filling
the tanks and in every way putting in perfect shape
the mammoth flyer.</p>

<p class='c004'>When, the next morning, the great bird of passage
was driven aloft, and leading a flock of lesser
’planes, the wheelmen on the job were Billy Barry
and Henri Trouville.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were fourteen, all told, on board, and Lieutenant
Moppa was in command. Two guns showed,
one fore and the other aft, manned by practiced
marksmen, while equally proficient in their line were
several riflemen in the crew. The two lieutenants
could be depended upon to take care of the explosive-dropping
assignment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though the motion of the huge machine through
the air was very smooth and graceful, the roaring
sound made by the four powerful engines, as the
airship forged ahead, high above the sea, was nothing
less than terrifying.</p>

<p class='c004'>The commanding officer kept his sailing orders to
himself, but, nevertheless, the belief among those
aboard, which would not down, was that the big
craft was going over the Bosphorus batteries,
straight to Islam’s capital, to give the ancient city,
for the first time in history, an air bombardment.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the rumor reached Billy, he thought of Sergius’
remark about “dying at the top of the profession!”</p>

<p class='c004'>To his brother wheelman, close enough to catch
his words, he had just been saying:</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is the kind of a gear we will have to put
together for our trip across the Atlantic.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the thought that the contract they had immediately
on hand, if the rumor had foundation,
might take all they had to give.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few miles from the entrance of the Bosphorus,
Lieutenant Moppa, instead of issuing a stop order,
in stentorian voice sounded the word:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Attention!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Above the roar of the engines the crew heard
again a shouted command:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pilots, guide left!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then all hands knew that the airship was headed
for Constantinople. The first link in the chain of
Bosphorus forts was below, and the sea of Marmora
only eighteen miles distant! The great
airship was going a mile a minute, following the water
line between the two continents, yet running so high
that gun flashes from the batteries were as the explosion
of so many firecrackers to the aviators.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boy pilots leaned hard against the steering
wheels; they were feeling the strain of continuous
effort, but made no call for relief. It was a red-letter
chapter in their flying record.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the sea of Marmora, stretching away 170
miles to the straits of the Dardanelles, on the other
end of which the allies had concentrated twenty
great battleships, eight powerful cruisers and a land
force of 50,000.</p>

<p class='c004'>Over Pera, the residence section of Constantinople,
Lieutenant Atlass sent down a shower of
bombs, and for miles of Moslem territory the onrushing
airship left a blazing trail behind it. The
“Sikorsky” had drawn the fire of many guns in its
dash between seas, and but for one stray bullet
that splintered the glass front of the pilot house
would have escaped unscathed.</p>

<p class='c004'>By fort fire the aviators were driven high again
over the Dardanelles, but the forty-two miles in
these straits were traversed in fifty minutes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Landing on the floats was made off Tenedos
island, in the Ægean sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You looked like a Zeppelin coming in,” hailed
a bluff Briton from the conning tower of a submarine
that had bobbed up alongside of the floating
aircraft, “and your colors just saved you from being
blown to smithereens. That’s the biggest thing
on wings you have there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And it has carved a new niche for aviators to
reach, this day,” proudly proclaimed the Russian
airman.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />SAVED BY SEAPLANES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The boy pilots completed their many hours of
trying vigil at the wheels of the largest aeroplane
ever built by guiding the immense craft to housing
place on the shore, and in the first night period of
relaxation were drowsily dead to the world.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll be twisting the heads off one another if
we lie this close,” jollied Billy, when his chum and
himself rolled into blankets on the verge of dreamland,
“for I’m still bow-legged in the arms from
holding those spokes, and the motion won’t leave
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This humor was lost on Henri, for he had gone
over the border, and no return until next sunrise.</p>

<p class='c004'>No need to awaken the youngsters from the eight
hours of slumber due them, for the morning will
do well enough for an interesting discovery coming
their way.</p>

<p class='c004'>Anticipating this awakening and a grand surprise,
however, it may be stated that among the operators
of the war-planes identified with the superdreadnaught
“Warspite,” then lying off Tenedos island,
were a couple of airmen of some renown along the
coast of the North Sea. They answered to the
names of the Leonidas Johnson, with complimentary
title of captain, and Josiah Freeman, one
time of Boston, U. S. A.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, again, in the British submarine E-14,
even then returning from a reconnoissance in the
Dardanelles mine field, there was a sailor lad from
Dover, Jimmy Stetson, surely remembered in the
live days when our Young Aeroplane Scouts were
campaigning in France and Belgium.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stirring times in front when these time-tried,
powder-burned excitement seekers get together once
more!</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Moppa was exhibiting the fine points
of the “Sikorsky” to a group of British naval officers
and war-plane experts when Billy and Henri
sauntered in that direction, sound sleep and a good
breakfast having restored them to normal condition.</p>

<p class='c004'>Something that the Russian said caused a turning
of all eyes upon the approaching lads.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two of the group opened their mouths as well
as their eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jumping Jehoshaphat,” cried one of the pair,
breaking the spell that bound him, “if it isn’t our
long-lost flying boys!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the great hornspoon,” almost shouted the
other, “the dead is alive!”</p>

<p class='c004'>While all the rest of the party looked on in astonishment,
the coming couple and the waiting two
indulged in a veritable war dance, accompanied by
handshaking and shoulder-slapping, until the four
were breathless and compelled to desist.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not a bit surprised now, sir,” declared Captain
Johnson, addressing the Russian officer; “these
kids are the candy in that game, born to it, sir; born
to it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Moppa, while somewhat puzzled as
to the “candy” qualification, nevertheless appreciated
the spirit of the hurrah indorsement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Set up a sky contest, sir,” added Freeman, “and
they wouldn’t have space on their clothes for all the
medals they would capture.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you fellows dry up,” laughed Billy, “or you
will get us arrested for false pretense. My first
duty is to Henri; he must be kept out of jail at all
hazards.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri was about to retort in kind when he received
a slap on the back that startled the idea out
of his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jimmy!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri spoke in one breath, and the
onlookers were amused by another animated walk-around.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the insistent call of duty broke in upon the
reunion. Johnson and Freeman climbed into a war-plane
for the morning reconnoitering flight over the
straits, and the submarine upon which Jimmy served
put out to sea on mission unknown.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our boys looked to Lieutenant Moppa for some
stirring order that would put them again in action,
but that officer made no sign that would indicate
immediate movement of the big airship. The
surmise was that the mighty craft would be held in
reserve for the allies’ next concentrated effort to force
the Dardanelles.</p>

<p class='c004'>It occurred to Billy and Henri that they could
obtain permission to serve with Johnson and
Freeman in the war-planes in case of emergency—and
to their eminent satisfaction such leave was granted,
for aviators were in constant demand. The heavily
mined waters made close scouting in surface boats
an exceedingly precarious proposition, and inside
the straits the fort guns speedily put anything but
a submarine out of business. Even the underwater
craft had short shrift when exposed.</p>

<p class='c004'>A day passed with no call for the services of the
young pilots, but when the summons did come it was
in a hurry-up manner, and involved a venture
perilous to the extreme.</p>

<p class='c004'>Submarine E-14 was aground on Kephez point!</p>

<p class='c004'>The submarine boat had started from Tenedos
island at midnight, entered the Dardanelles at 2:20
in the morning and dived at 2:30 to avoid the
searchlights. Carried forward by the strong
current it grounded four hours later, with the
conning tower showing out of the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Picket boats reported at Tenedos that the
stranded submarine was under fire from the
Turkish batteries, and that there was little or no chance
of the crew escaping annihilation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson, engaged in conversation at the
time with Billy and Henri, upon hearing the direful
news, cried out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s Jimmy Stetson’s boat!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t we do anything?” was Billy’s frantic
query.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can volunteer to make a try,” replied the
captain, as he raced to the water front, closely
followed by the excited boys.</p>

<p class='c004'>Freeman was standing near the seaplane station
when the runners arrived.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson reeled off the story of the submarine
mishap with telegraph speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m in it every minute,” stoutly declared Josh,
when advised of the rescue movement.</p>

<p class='c004'>The volunteers instantly received the orders they
sought, and with equal celerity set out on a mission
that literally meant flying in the face of death.</p>

<p class='c004'>They rode in two seaplanes that many times before
had weathered storms of shot and shell.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson, himself, veteran of the air,
acted as pilot in the lead, for he knew the direct
route to the scene of the submarine disaster, and
with Henri at the motor end. Billy guided the escort
machine, with Josh behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The seaplanes, of the very largest type, had capacity
to carry, in a short run, at least a dozen of the
submarine crew, if, indeed, that many had survived
the pitiless fire to which they had for nearly an hour
been exposed, and which fusillading had crippled
the electric power appliance of the underwater craft.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sweeping around the point, the shattered submarine
was located by upstanding bridge and periscope,
but the crew had been obliged to leave the
boat and crawl out into the mud which held the
bow aground.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through an atmosphere dense with powder
smoke, the seaplanes sped like bolts, and then striking
the water with a force that tossed spray in every
direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>The submarine captain and three of the crew had
been killed, and of those still alive seven were
wounded. To cover the movement of the seaplanes,
the “Warspite” and other British warships
kept a rain of shells falling in the vicinity of the
Turkish battery.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the seaplanes lifted from the water, the
wounded members of the submarine crew were
crowded inside, and others clung to the rigging.
The powerful motors responded wonderfully to the
test.</p>

<p class='c004'>Reaching the turn of the point without being
brought down by the parting shots from the Turkish
battery, the overloaded aircraft soon settled in
the shelter of the warships outside the entrance of
the straits.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Glory be!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy’s high note of rejoicing had been sounded.</p>

<p class='c004'>And there was Jimmy Stetson, without a mark,
astride the bow of the seaplane!</p>

<p class='c004'>Other aviators in lighter machines now hovered
over the submarine, dropping bombs on the works
above water, with the purpose of rendering the lost
vessel absolutely useless to the Turks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was a scary come-through, all right,” said
Jimmy to Billy, when once within the safety line.
“I saw my finish out on that mud pile, and I guess
I didn’t care much after Captain Gardiner fell dead
on the bridge. But somehow, when I saw those seaplanes
swooping down, and glimpsed Captain Johnson,
I took a fresh hold on hope. And, lo and behold,
when I splashed out to the planes who should
be sitting in there as large as life but you and Henri.
It was the spirit again of the brave old days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We surely have had some close calls together,
come to think of it,” recalled Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, now that the good boat, E-14, has gone by
the board, I am out of a job,” sighed Jimmy; “I
knew that craft like a book, and no better diver than
she is in the service.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Brace up, Master James,” was Billy’s word of
cheer, accompanied by a slap between the shoulders
of the Dover boy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jimmy, it proved, had no reason to complain of
enforced leisure; indeed, the only change in his line
of duty was that by boat register he moved ahead a
couple of numbers, hereafter to travel in E-16—and
this underwater craft happened to be the very
one detailed to attempt the difficult and hazardous
task of cutting a submarine cable.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri were to have a share in this same
risky enterprise, but without knowledge in advance
of what was coming to them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />THE CUTTING OF A CABLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Submarine E-16, taking an air bath off Tenedos,
and floating in the shadow of the mighty “Warspite,”
awaited orders that would send her night-groping
under the strong current of the Dardanelles
channel, and with the set purpose of clipping a cable
connecting the European and Asiatic shores of the
straits.</p>

<p class='c004'>If not detected by the Turkish searchlights, the
expedition might win forward, and, perhaps, back.
Captain Montgomery, a regular fire-eater, was in
command, with a picked crew, including our young
friend, Jimmy Stetson.</p>

<p class='c004'>The enterprise was to have aviation aid, and
sure-shot candidates for such participation were the
veteran pair, Johnson and Freeman. As there was
possibility of a bit of a scrap before the affair ended,
it was deemed expedient to carry extra pilots in
case of accident.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keeping it all in the family,” was Johnson’s
humorous way of later telling Billy and Henri that
he wanted them to go along.</p>

<p class='c004'>The upshot of it was that in the late afternoon
of the day fixed for the undertaking, two biplanes
rose high above the Ægean sea, high enough to
make them appear as mere specks in the sky. Turning
north, their course followed the line of the Dardanelles.</p>

<p class='c004'>The submarine waited for nightfall before it
made the plunge that would start its journey in
the same direction pursued by the aircraft on high.</p>

<p class='c004'>Porus-Tabia battery, on the European shore of
the straits, stands close to the ruins of the ancient
stone fort, Bokal-Kale, from where there is a submarine
cable that connects it with Nagara on the
Asiatic shore.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was the cable that the military promoters of
the submarine journey proposed to sever, if they
got near enough to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviators were to play into the scheme in
some manner yet to be developed. It would not be
Johnson or Freeman if their long heads failed them
on this or any other occasion. It was a safe wager
that they had some sort of working plan up their
sleeves, and the two boys in their company were
certainly ready to produce a vote of confidence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lay of the land here is an elevation, not approachable
from the front without sure discovery,
but some opportunity for concealment at the rear—more
favorable, for example, for a drop-down party
to operate and escape immediate detection.</p>

<p class='c004'>Four aviators, at least, were taking the chance of
a night prowl here, after coming down at dusk, with
muffled motors, behind a clump of trees, and within
fairly easy reach of the ruins of the ancient fortress.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, my hearties,” advised Captain Johnson,
when the four edged against a clammy stone wall
for council, “this is only a two-gun battery; the garrison
is not expecting company at the back door,
and for this reason it’s a fair shake that we might
be able to attend to a little business here and get
away with it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The active end of this position, further up,” he
continued, “I propose to visit a little later on, and it
is a crawling contract all the way. I feel sure that
the two guns here are in need of repair, and I guess
I’ll have to fix them!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain mixed a chuckle with these concluding
words, and set a deep bite in a lengthy plug of
tobacco.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the object, anyhow, of this cable-cutting
business?” asked Billy, who liked to dig at the roots
of anything that puzzled him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To strike terror in the heart of the Turk,” commenced
the captain—but he switched off to the practical
statement that he only knew that military
strategy demanded it—and so ordered. To the soldier
this latter was all-sufficient reason.</p>

<p class='c004'>This conversation was in tone audible only to the
closely knit group in hiding.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the captain was making ready to “repair”
the guns above the water front. He took off his
boots and his topcoat, transferring therefrom to the
inside of his blouse a tool commonly known as a
monkey-wrench, tightened his belt and pulled his
cap down to his ears. Revolvers swelled both of
his hip-pockets.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you hear any shooting,” he whispered, “just
make a break for the biplanes, stand by until you
see ’em coming, if I don’t get there first, and then
pull out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With these words the veteran airman disappeared
in the darkness with all the stealth of an Indian in
moccasins.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When the submarine crowd gets to work on the
shore end of the cable there will be a stew in the
operating room up here. The captain fears that in
the excitement those defective guns might explode
and hurt somebody. That’s the reason he is so anxious
to get everything fixed to prevent accident.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Josh’s explanation was taken no more seriously
than he intended it to be. The boys knew well
enough that the captain was taking his life in his
hands to so upset the mechanism of the guns that
they could not be used in throwing lead at the submarine,
if discovered during the cable-cutting performance.</p>

<p class='c004'>An hour passed, in which the anxious waiters,
in the chill precincts of the ruins, would have
promptly testified was six times sixty minutes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy started to say as much, when Josh gave him
a poke in the ribs in the way of mute advice to keep
still.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was some sort of commotion breaking out
in the quarters of the cable operators, at the north
end of the ruins.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Something doing now, sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri sidestepped further along the wall in order
to get a little closer to the scene of action.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The connection’s shut off, that’s what’s the matter,”
predicted Josh, speaking into Billy’s ear. “The
job down below is going on. We’ll know in a
minute or two whether or not the captain has ‘fixed’
the big guns.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A door was flung open and a broad stream of
light penetrated the outside darkness. In the illuminated
opening was framed a stalwart Turk, and
he started a yell, which found echo in the high-pitched
voices of several more of the fez wearers
behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sentries at the fort, two hundred yards distant,
responded quickly to the summons, coming in
twos and threes, pell mell, toward the cable station,
brandishing their rifles, and doing some shouting on
their own account.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gee whiz,” muttered Billy, “it’s a regular riot!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then to the rear of this noisy demonstration, the
real note of alarm to the trio of watchers in the
ruins rang out in the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crack, crack—the whiplike snap of small-bore
shooting irons!</p>

<p class='c004'>The last words of the captain had been for his
companions to make for the biplanes when shooting
commenced. In compliance, the trio retreated
in single file, close to the wall, and then ran like
deer across the open, luckily for them a little way
and partially screened by trees.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up to the moment there was never a boom from
the big guns, and even the spatting of the lesser
weapons had ceased after the first few shots.</p>

<p class='c004'>As instructed, Josh and the boys “stood by” the
biplanes. The captain had failed to get there first,
and it did not look like he was going to even get
there next, for already the soldiers of the garrison
were scattering in search of a certain disturber, who
had the nerve to fire back when he was fired at.</p>

<p class='c004'>The entire garrison appeared to be charging
about except the disgusted gunners, who found that
they could not pump even a single shell at a suspicious-looking
object off the water front.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cable operators, with a number of the sentries,
had raced down the steep incline to where the
cable lifted from under the current of the straits.
The casing of the wires on shore had twisted up
like a great snake, hacked apart from the tension-creating
line under the channel.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a scant minute or two the far-reaching rays
from the lighthouse tower on Bakkal headland
splintered on a polished surface like a whale’s back,
which quickly disappeared in a circle of foam below
the rushing tide.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gunners above had seen much more of the
submarine before it dived, but that is about all the
good it did them.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was dawn before any of the Turks stumbled
upon the hiding place of the aviators and their craft,
and there was only four of this advance guard.</p>

<p class='c004'>Josh counted a red furrow across the cheek after
the first fire, and retaliated with one of the big service
revolvers he carried, sending the marksman
who marked him to the ground with a shattered
knee-pan. Another of the attacking party got a
chunk of lead in the shoulder, and the remaining
two backed out for reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the meantime, the boy pilots had started the
motors to humming, and Josh, though his fighting
blood was up, concluded that there were too many
coming just then, and hopped aboard with Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not by a blamed sight are we leaving the captain
to skirmish for himself,” he announced with
the uprise; “we’ll hang around here till doomsday
but what we’ll get him out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a mighty brief hang-around, after all, for
the aviators were barely out of range of the Turks’
rifles, when Billy’s quick and roving eye caught the
vivid flutter of a bandana handkerchief, Captain
Johnson’s favorite colors, from a cactus cluster in
the sandy expanse over which the aircraft circled.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Turkish troopers had ceased fire at the biplanes—a
mere waste of powder now—but when
they saw one of the machines dip and dive, a dozen
or more of them, howling in triumph over the belief
that their bullets really had winged one of the
big flyers, charged full tilt across the plain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy, however, had the bulge on the quick-comers,
in that he was skimming the sandy soil before
the Turks were fairly started, and Captain Johnson
swung a leg in the aeroplane without compelling a
stop.</p>

<p class='c004'>The soldiers popped away with their rifles, but
made no holes in the deceptive target. On the rise,
Captain Johnson gave them a couple of rounds from
his revolvers, and shouted, as a farewell salute:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dern your pictures, haven’t you got enough yet?
We’ll come back some day and carry off the whole
fort!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course,” concluded the captain, settling into
his seat in the space-killing biplane, “they couldn’t
understand a word, but there is nothing like relieving
your mind of extra pressure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He also relieved the tobacco plug of about a
third of its weight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />RIDING A HURRICANE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“We did the trick in fine style,” proclaimed
Jimmy Stetson, at next sight of the young aviators,
“but twice we missed a mine by eyelash length, and
I warrant if we hadn’t, your record of lofty travel
would be knocked in the head.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We had some little experience ourselves,” modestly
advanced Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The three boys, perched on a cracker box, compared
notes until Jimmy was called away by a submarine
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is on our list to-day?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri pretended to look for answer to his chum’s
question in a worse-for-wear notebook.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only a dinner engagement,” he gravely stated,
“and that’s four hours to come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here comes Lieutenant Moppa,” observed Billy;
“maybe he can prescribe something besides a rest
cure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You might suggest, Buddy, that we all go over
and knock a chip off the old town.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri was referring to Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do your own suggesting,” advised Billy, rising
to greet the Russian officer. “We were just talking,
sir, about the effect of nothing-to-do on the
nerves.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long have you been at peace with yourselves
and the world?” laughingly queried the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think about nine hours now,” replied Billy,
looking at his battered silver watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will be going to seed, I am sure, if this
state of things continues. By the way,” continued
the officer, “I was about to tell you that the big airship
is going into commission for a run around to
the Gulf of Enos, backing up the British move on
the Turkish port there. Heavy bombardment is already
in progress, I am told, and we propose to
show our allies that all the shaking up of the enemy
is not to be performed by the land and water forces.
As you know, we can put a choice lot of bomb droppers
into the game. The largest aeroplane in the
world did not come over here just for a show.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thought you were not going to make your move
until the warships got ready to break through the
straits,” interposed Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is just it,” said the lieutenant; “they are
not in quite the shape for the grand rush, and in
the meantime I want to get in a helping stroke wherever
else I can. There is too much of the ‘Sikorsky’
to knock about in these little scouting operations,
but the kind of an engagement now going on at
Enos, I believe, is something nearer our size.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This talk was interrupted by terrific cannonading.
Four British warships had entered the Dardanelles
and were shelling the Turkish forts—getting
vigorous response from the shore batteries.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys caught sight of Captain Johnson hustling
for the water front, and so apparent was their
anxiety to get on the trail of their old friend that
the Russian officer told them to skip out, but on no
account to fail in reporting to him the following
morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold on there, my lads,” called Josh Freeman,
whose track they crossed, and who also seemed to
be answering an emergency summons, “Johnson
isn’t going to start till I catch up, and maybe we
will give you a lift.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For this very invitation the boys were hoping,
and they immediately reduced speed to correspond
with the slower stride of the veteran aviator.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ordered to signal work,” announced the captain,
as Josh and the boys joined him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who’s up for pilots?” queried Freeman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The commander left the details to me,” rejoined
Johnson.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’re ‘it’ then,” declared Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You take a whole lot for granted,” bantered the
captain, with a wink at Josh.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviators had their way, for it was just
the way that suited Captain Johnson.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hovering over the warships engaged in the bombardment,
Johnson and Freeman, as observers and
signal scouts, by the flag code kept the range finders
on the gun decks apprised of the shots that told, as
well as those that were ineffective.</p>

<p class='c004'>They also showed the sign of warning against
the approach of several Turkish torpedo boats,
which were quickly turned by the hot reception
measures taken by the warship gunners.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several times in the lower strata the circling biplanes
were jarred and dangerously shaken by the
concussion of the tremendous gun-play.</p>

<p class='c004'>On these occasions a rapid upshoot restored the
fluttering flying machines again to even keel.</p>

<p class='c004'>For three or four hours the four daring aviators
were aloft and running the whole gamut of air perils
attendant upon signal service over cross-fire of big
guns.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the retirement of the cruisers came relief,
and when Billy and Henri got the word to backtrack
they sent the machines along like two streaks
of lightning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That ought to hold you a day or two,” grimly
observed Captain Johnson, stamping the kinks out
of his legs on the landing place, and addressing his
young friends, who were also working off the strain
by a vigorous arm-rubbing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Another job in the morning,” stated Billy, “and
in a house on wings. Come around and see us start,
captain, you and Josh.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure and we will,” assured the captain, “for that
Russian craft beats all hollow, for size, any airship
I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A word that evening from Lieutenant Moppa
cinched the belief that it was a certain go, and Billy
and Henri joined the other experts employed in
preparing for the flight of the mighty machine.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Atlass assumed the responsibility for
the storage of the explosives to be carried, and it
can be stated that this officer had an assignment of
the utmost importance. If anything went wrong
in the magazines the travelers aboard the craft
would never know what hurt them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri waved good-bye to Captain
Johnson and Josh from the door of the pilots’ cabin on
the “Sikorsky” and then set their grips on the steering
wheels as the starting signal was given. With
the four engines roaring, the great bird of passage
soared over the sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the compass, the course was set southwest, for
the point at which the expedition aimed is on that
extreme quarter of the Turkish domain.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first fighting viewed from the immense aeroplane
was on and off the Gallipoli peninsula, where
warships of the allies were hot-shotting the Turkish
land positions.</p>

<p class='c004'>But just about this time the barometer in the air
pilot’s cabin was the center of attraction for the
commanding officer and the wheelmen.</p>

<p class='c004'>The indications were of decidedly ugly aspect,
and storms in these parts were notable for their
violence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hadn’t we better take to the floats, lieutenant?”
inquired Billy, feeling new resistance in the wheel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moppa from the lookout seat noted the turbulence
of the waves far below, and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better go higher,” he directed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pilots set the planes for the ordered ascent.
So fierce now were the gusts against them that they
were compelled to turn and ride with the gale, which
had, with awful suddenness, expanded in shrieking
force. The broadside for the few minutes presented,
very near proved the drivers’ complete undoing,
for the immense fabric could not be shifted
with the celerity of the lesser craft heretofore handled
by the boys, and it heeled over in a most alarming
manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Steady, lads,” shouted the commanding officer,
as Atlass and himself lent helping hands in holding
the pounding wheels.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Steady it is, sir,” cried Billy, like an old salt,
and “steady” it was when the craft beam-ended to
the hurricane. But at what a speed! Two of the
engines were cut off to slow the propellers, yet nothing
short of 90 miles to the hour was still maintained.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sense of location was as speedily lost. So
many deviations were there in the cyclonic flight
that the dancing compass needle lost its value as a
true guide.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a toss up whether the airship would bump
into Athens or Smyrna, if it did not before hit the
bottom of the sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pilots ever endeavored to keep the nose of
the craft on the upturn, in the hope of overriding
the terror howling behind it. That they succeeded
to some extent had proof in a slight easing of the
strain on the steering gear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Still blowing like Sam Hill,” exclaimed Henri,
“but the wrench isn’t near as strong as it was.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The four at the wheels were dripping with
perspiration from their muscle-racking experience.
The balance of the company of nine men, with the
exception of the engineer, were huddled in a bunch
in the “corridor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>About everything movable on the airship was
scattered about the deck. Atlass had many a dark
thought regarding the explosives, and, no doubt, as
many times thanked his stars that he had done a
thorough job of packing.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had more than once exchanged glances with
Moppa when a particularly violent vibration was
felt in the vessel. They were both thinking alike,
and of the magazines.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the storm died away and the sea no longer
leaped in wild waves, the pilots essayed a cautious
descent, by slow degrees. The compass showed the
movement due south, but there was nothing to convince
as to how far south.</p>

<p class='c004'>No land was visible to the naked eye, but Lieutenant
Moppa, having resumed lookout duty,
announced that with his binocle he perceived a faint
blue line in direction directly ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ease her off a point or two,” he commanded,
“and hold this course without change.” With a
second thought, he further ordered: “Let Mowbray
and Gault take the wheels. You boys will be
dead on your feet if you do not quit for a while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri rather reluctantly relinquished
their guiding posts, though, if the truth be known,
both were rather shaky in the legs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new pilots, however, had plain sailing, and
the boys felt that they had done their full duty, and
more, when it had really counted for something.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sailing lower and lower, the big airship, with
driving force reduced to one engine, slowly approached
a strip of land in the sea, now quite plainly
visible to the crew.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were military forces assembled on this
ground, and it was Henri who first distinguished
their nationality, when close enough to distinguish
color. Blue tunics and red trousers—that was
enough, without waiting to set eyes on the top display
of red kepis, surmounted by the familiar tri-color
cockade and ball.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re French!” he shouted. “The real thing.
Vive, La France!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The port was Mudros, on Lemnos island, in the
Ægean sea, where 35,000 French and British soldiers
had just landed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Descend.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With the command the pilots lowered the “Sikorsky”
to the water level.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Vive, La France!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri’s exulting shout was heard again as a boat
shot out from the shore to meet the gigantic aeroplane
drifting in on its polished floats.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />LOFTY GUN PRACTICE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When the identity of the Russian aircraft had
been established, the big ship was landed, and the
aviators mingled with the soldiers on shore. Henri
was particularly active in making the rounds among
the French contingent.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had been separated from his companions for
less than a half hour, when they saw him coming,
with a joy-illumined face and a skip between every
other step. At Henri’s side, but at a more dignified
pace and looking every inch a soldier in the
uniform of a French artilleryman, walked a youth
who commanded immediate recognition from Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello, François,” cried the Bangor boy, rushing
forward with outstretched hand, and the newcomer
so hurried his stride that he came more than
half way with his warm return of happy greeting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The world isn’t so wide, after all,” laughingly
declared Henri. “What do you think of us running
up against one another in this out of the way
neck of the woods? It is the remotest thing on
earth that would have entered my mind. But isn’t
it great?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys had last seen François, Henri’s brother,
in a hospital at war-torn Arras, these many days
agone, and how much of history had been written in
red since that meeting!</p>

<p class='c004'>François, then pale, worn and suffering from a
serious wound, was now straight as an arrow, ruddy
of cheek, and in gallant array of blue and red.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve heard all about how you and brother here,”
he said to Billy, “saved for mother the family fortune,
and it would make your ears burn were I to
tell you all else that has been related of your courage
and fidelity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go lightly on that, please,” was Billy’s modest
plea; “let’s talk about something different—cabbages
or kings, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>François laughed. “Same old boy, I see, bound
to bloom under cover. Oh, well, you can’t get away
from your record, so have it as you please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say, Billy,” broke in Henri, “I haven’t had a
chance to tell you before, but the bold Britons have
broken into Enos, and that storm caused us to miss
the grand entry. It was something of a scrap, too,
I hear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t worry about that,” observed François;
“just take a run over to Smyrna instead; you will
get all the thrills you desire there along about now—the
allies’ aviators are scattering bombs all over
the place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s a chance for the ‘Sikorsky’ to show
them a thing or two in the way of distributing fireworks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri recalled the showering the Russian lieutenants
gave Constantinople as they passed over
the ancient city coming down from the Bosphorus.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s your route?” inquired Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t know exactly,” replied François, “but I
fancy it will be the Dardanelles for us. The transports
have been waiting for several days to take
our troops somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That will give us another look at you soon,”
rejoiced Henri, “for our craft is going to be mighty
close to the front when the real push is made.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Within forty-eight hours the boys witnessed the
embarking of all the Anglo-French forces, with the
exception of a few battalions left at Mudros, for renewed
assault on the Turkish defenses of the Gallipoli
peninsula. François was among the departing
troops, and with farewell words of gay
assurance that he would soon meet again his brother and
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Moppa, enthused over the reports of
aviation activity at Smryna, and determined to give
the “Sikorsky” another long-distance try-out, ordered
immediate flight toward the coast of Asia
Minor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Barring a storm disturbance,” declared the officer
in command, “our four engines ought to hit the
high mark of going this time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On this journey the barometer proved not at all
fractious, and it was easy sailing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviators found a large number of troop
transports off Smyrna, and on the very day of the
arrival of the big airship a French airman dropped
two bombs on Fort Kastro, killing several soldiers;
another sank a German ship lying in port, and a
third struck the railroad station.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Those French flyers certainly are a busy lot,”
commented Lieutenant Moppa. The occupants of
the “Sikorsky,” in coming on high, had a full and
open view of these effective aeroplane maneuvers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aviators on the Russian craft were also impressed
with the fact that about 40,000 Turks were
engaged in the defense of Smyrna, well entrenched
on heights commanding the city.</p>

<p class='c004'>Constantinople had just contributed thirty heavy
guns to the equipment of the defenders.</p>

<p class='c004'>Joining the allies in the offing, the mammoth machine,
which dwarfed the other planes to small proportions
by comparison, excited much curiosity, and
attracted many ceremonial visits from the officers
of the attacking forces.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Moppa was more than willing to accept
a test of efficiency of his ship and the metal of
his men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The only trouble is, your oversized aeroplane
presents too big a target for close flying,” argued
a member of the French aviation corps.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps so,” smilingly returned the lieutenant,
“but we are elusive enough at a speed of 90 miles
an hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it is a powerful machine, no question about
that,” cheerfully conceded the French aviator. “I
would like very much to make a trial trip with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have the invitation,” promptly stated the
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the “Sikorsky” made a demonstration the
next day over Forts Two Brothers and Bastrati,
on Smyrna heights, the Frenchman was an interested
passenger, and the four engines, working all
at once, gave him an earful of noise that he had
not expected. He was no less surprised at the youth
of the pilots, but was soon convinced that they were
star performers at the wheels.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wonderful work there,” he said to Lieutenant
Moppa, after the big craft had been put through all
the paces of scientific planing.</p>

<p class='c004'>This flight, however, was not intended solely as
an exhibition trip. Lieutenant Atlass was soon
working overtime with his bomb-dropping specialty,
and Mowbray and Gault, the aviator-gunners, swiveled
the little growlers, mounted fore and aft, in
most effective manner, raising many a howl from
the trenches with their expert downfire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fighters in the fortifications were not slow
themselves in showing that this was no holiday set
apart for rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>They banged away with more vigor than precision
at the huge fabric above them, and occasionally
put a dent in the armor of the aerial tormentor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your enclosures, I guess, have saved us many a
flesh clip from spent balls,” said the French aviator,
who was standing in the fore-cabin with Lieutenant
Moppa.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wouldn’t be surprised,” responded the officer,
“yet if we held one position long enough, there is
no telling what a shell might do to us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was the business of Billy and Henri to see
that no fixed position was presented to the aim of
a long range gun.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was just thinking,” remarked Billy, in an aside
to his fellow wheelman, “that if a chunk of lead
should happen to strike full force one of those
magazines forward they’d be picking up pieces of
us for a week in Siberia or some other section of
nowhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Far be the dark moment,” fervently declared
Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>Happening to glance sidewise through the windows
of the pilot house, the last speaker saw a biplane
lifting from the level between the two forts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say, Buddy,” he called, “they’re going to fight
us in our own strata. There’s another of ’em coming
up—and yet another. Three to mix with.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Moppa himself had just sighted the
hostile aircraft, and he ordered the gunners to
watch for an opportunity to put a check on the flying
challengers if they ventured too close. The
men serving the airship’s little battery, however,
needed no encouragement. They were keyed up to
best effort for the difficult test of marksmanship—wing
shooting from under wings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There goes one of their popguns,” cried Mowbray,
as a smoke wreath showed at the bow of the
leading Turkish aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keep the nose right at them,” the lieutenant instructed
the pilots, “as long as they come together.
Don’t present a side view unless you have to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If they get far enough away from the forts
what’s the matter with bumping them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>This suggestion from Henri did not seem to
appeal to Lieutenant Moppa, who lifted a hand in
protest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would be taking big chances for mighty small
game,” he asserted. “Let Mowbray and Gault give
them the tumble at long range.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The first named gunner at the moment blazed
away, and with successful result, to which he testified
with a whoop of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One down,” he yelled; “only crippled, maybe,
but out of the game.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and you have spoiled the day for the other
two; they are not coming to see the air circus at
all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Lieutenant Atlass who announced the retirement
of the bold navigators. What with
Mowbray’s center shot, the roaring of the four engines
and the appalling size of the great airship, it had
been all sufficient to send the Turkish craft to cover.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see how it is,” chuckled the French aviator;
“they thought we had rigged one of the warships
with wings, and the idea scared them stiff.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The “Sikorsky” after a week’s service over the
Turkish entrenchments, on the heights of Smyrna,
started on return voyage to Tenedos, where Lieutenant
Moppa proposed now to hold the big craft
in readiness for that long-expected summons to
meet the Russian fleet when it should win through
the Bosphorus. That this was a near coming event,
the officer implicitly believed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri were not so much concerned in
the whys and wherefores that prompted the backtracking
as they were in the prospect of rejoining
Captain Johnson and Josh.</p>

<p class='c004'>With these old scouts, as Billy said, “there was
something doing every day.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br />IN THE HANDS OF THE TURKS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The “Sikorsky,” being out of commission until
further orders, the boys had the liberty of free
lances, and, by favor of the British military authorities
at Tenedos, accompanied an aerial fleet
dispatched to the north, to work for a time with
the forces of General Hamilton, recently landed on
the northern side of the Gulf of Saros and also
opening at various points on the Gallipoli peninsula.
In spite of serious opposition from the Turks
in strong entrenchments protected by barbed wire,
the khaki-clad troops were continuing to advance toward
the interior when the aviation aids arrived at
the scene of action.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying contingent included the veterans, Captain
Johnson and his inseparable, Josh Freeman, to
whom, without doubt, Billy and Henri owed their
chance of getting places in the expedition.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We may have to operate separately, young
man,” advised the captain, “and take assignments
as they come, and I want to urge that you have a
care about overleaping orders. I know you of old,
and know that you sometimes forget that there is a
limit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s a lecture on caution from a man who
never dodged dangerous duty in his life,” laughed
Billy; “we have acquired a whole lot of wisdom,
professor, since we joined the war college over
here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But still I have my eye on you,” persisted the
captain, with an attempt to hide a broad smile by
a turn of the head.</p>

<p class='c004'>If it so happened that the boys really did overshoot
the mark early in the advance movement, the
fault was none of their promoting, and the authority
for the mishap was close behind them when it
befell.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy was piloting no less a personage than “Daring
Dan” Macauley, and Henri had behind him
Marcus Jones Canby, also a hairbreadth member
of the famous Seventh Corps, when they struck the
snag that tumbled them within the Turkish lines.</p>

<p class='c004'>The war-planes carrying our boys and soldier
observers started from Enos at break of day to
reconnoiter the territory along the Gulf of Saros,
and get as near as possible to the line of defenses
above the Dardanelles, on the Marmora sea coast.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was first acquaintance day with the pilots and
their companions. The two behind and the pair in
front had no knowledge of just how they would balance
when it came to a weighing in of their metal
on the scales of emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'>If, however, the young aviators expected restraint
in the matter of taking risks, they were entertaining
an error in their minds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Macauley and Canby were as free-handed in the
acceptance of danger as any two men living, of
which fact the wheelmen were very soon aware.</p>

<p class='c004'>So the journey proceeded further and further
afield without a word of protest from the officers,
until all of a sudden the aircraft were in rapid ascent
to clear a fortress crowning an elevation five
hundred feet above sea level.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rising above the battery, the aviators looked
down and out upon the Sea of Marmora. It proved
that the garrison here was on the alert, acutely so,
for the reason that the British invasion of the peninsula
to the near west had sent a note of alarm up
and down the coast.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before Henri could get the war-plane he was
guiding wholly out of range, a sharpshooter on
one of the four towers of the Seddil-Bahr fort
opened up with a Mauser magazine rifle, and to the
ill fortune of the airmen sent a bullet where it
would do most harm in the propeller section of the
craft.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young pilot comprehended in a mental flash
that a downshoot of the wings of the war-plane was
the only thing to do, and he made it a long slide,
so long, indeed, that the garrison waiting for the
capture never made it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the landing on Marmora Island offered no
other than the same result—the aviators had fallen
into a web too wide for avoidance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy never hesitated a minute in volplaning in
the trail of the crippled machine, and the two warplanes
alighted almost at the same time.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviators jumped at the job of attempting
repair, but failed to finish before they and
their companions were surrounded by Turks.
Macauley and Canby instinctively reached for their
revolvers, but it would have availed nothing to resist,
and would mean certain death from the muzzles
of a score of rifles covering them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hands down, Mac.,” was Canby’s cool and quiet
address to his comrade; “we are up against it, and
no use of making a bark.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The captive airmen were marched off to
Marmora town between a double file of soldiers, while
other islanders brought up the rear, dragging the
war-planes.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the Turkish officers spoke French, indicated
by the few questions he asked in that language,
principally as to what had caused the downfall
of the aeroplane. The uniforms worn by
Macauley and Canby presented all the evidence required
showing that they belonged to the peninsula
invaders.</p>

<p class='c004'>That it was proposed to take the prisoners away
from the island forthwith was impressed by the incoming,
upon signal, of a small steamboat, and the
immediate ushering aboard of the airmen, who soon
learned that the destination was Islam’s capital city.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Going right to headquarters,” remarked “Daring
Dan,” as the four leaned over the steamer rail
watching the swirl of the tide, “and no cards with
us to send on to the sultan.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope the beds are well aired at the jail,”
drawled Canby, catching the humor of his comrade.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri were wondering just what the
Turks were really going to do with them.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not until the following morning that the
young aviators saw the marble minarets of Constantinople
sparkling in the sunlight, and little reckoned
then that they were soon to pass the “high
door” or “Sublime porte,” the principal entrance of
the sultan’s palace, which rose in grandeur on the
extreme point of the promontory where the ancient
city stands. Just then the boys were more inclined
to the belief that locks and bars were to form the
only vision coming to them for many a day.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s where the ‘blood brotherhood’ won’t
count,” sighed Henri, reminded of their Cossack
relation by happening to touch the amulet in his
blouse pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Might trade these flints for crescents,” suggested
Billy, “only I’m afraid we couldn’t bluff the
Turks with that sort of game.”</p>

<p class='c004'>While the boys were speaking the steamboat was
puffing into the Golden Horn, an inlet of the sea,
at the north of the promontory.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once on the central quay of the harbor the prisoners
were marched through an exceedingly crooked
and tortuous street to the forbidding front of a
gloomy-looking and huge pile of bygone architecture,
and a few minutes later were the sole occupants
of an immense and dimly lighted apartment,
stone-walled and furnished only with a few wooden
benches, upon two of which the disconsolate quartette
seated themselves and waited in dreary anticipation
for the next deal of fate.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br />SEEING THE SULTAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“If it should please the gentleman in the bushy
trousers who served as chief of the reception committee
to place some light repast before us, he
would at this moment fill a long-felt want.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Canby was not constructed to remain under a
cloud for any lengthy period, and he proceeded with
his inimitable drawl to divert the dismal train of
thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Turn me loose in the corridor out there with
the fellow who appropriated my revolvers,”
growled the fighting Macauley, “and I will credit
it up to a change of luck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tut, tut, Danny, you must cease exercising your
temper,” chided Canby, with a grin; “always meet
misfortune with a May morning face.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You go hang,” replied “Daring Dan,” who was
compelled to smile in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your suggestion respectfully turned down,” bantered
Canby, “and the same to the Turk, even if
he should insist upon it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Turkish officer who had brought the prisoners
up from Marmora just then made his appearance,
accompanied by a couple of attendants, who
served an excellent brand of coffee to the captives,
along with plates of sweetmeats. When the two
Britons finally located themselves behind huge cigarettes,
also presented by their captor, they were in
a mood to seek information as to the near future.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We would be in great distress if the brave visitors
should soon depart,” was the roundabout answer
to the question of Canby as to what he and
his companions might expect, and the evasive words
were spoken with oriental gravity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Macauley shrugged his shoulders. “Much good
it does you to try and pump him”—this an aside to
his comrade.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Turk raised his eyes, but by no other sign
showed interest in or desire to know what the Briton
had said to his mate.</p>

<p class='c004'>“May I have a word with the young gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Turk bowed to Billy and Henri, who had
been singularly silent for them, and still engaged
with some of the confections that came with the
coffee.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go ahead, your excellency,” said the Bangor
boy, returning the salutation with a short nod.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must request that you go with me for a brief
hour or two.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what about our friends here?” asked Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I beg that they will excuse you for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With this, the Turk stepped aside and motioned
the boys to precede him through the doorway. Having
no other choice, the lads marched out, with assurance
to Macauley and Canby that they would
return as soon as permitted to do so.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hope it is all for your good that you are going,”
wished Canby.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Same here,” added “Daring Dan.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A ride of twenty minutes in a closed carriage,
and the boys stepped out in front of a large and
lofty gate, the principal entrance to the grounds of
a palace, which, with its buildings, pavilions, gardens
and groves, occupied a large space.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pinch me and see if I’m awake,” urged Billy,
under his breath, and Henri was equally stranded
in his wonder.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their guide seemed to grow in serious mien, and
his attitude was one of new importance. With
bent head he led a long march through magnificent
halls, decorated more in European than oriental
style, and finally a splendid stairway with crystal
balustrade was ascended to the second floor of the
palace, where the boys were ushered into a small,
plainly furnished private parlor, in marked contrast
to its surroundings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Seated on a divan, near a grate in which a cheerful
fire was crackling, and with several uniformed
officers standing near, was a keen-eyed man, wearing
lightly a weight of years, and otherwise the
conventional red calpac or fez of Turkey, a low
white collar, gray cravat, blue serge suit and black
shoes of comfortable cut, but no jewelry of any sort.</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer standing nearest the divan, evidently
of high rank, turned to look at the boys, who, just
inside of the door and nervously fingering their
caps, awaited some word that would set them
straight.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mentioned official, who was doing the looking
over, also acted as spokesman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“These are the flying boys?” was the question he
put to the guide.</p>

<p class='c004'>The individual behind the lads nodded assent.
He gently pushed his charges closer to the questioner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are the youths who guide airships, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c004'>This interrogation straight at the boys.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is our business,” modestly advanced Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know also of their construction?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” replied the Bangor boy, “we are factory
trained.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then followed a series of questions relating to the
heavier-than-air machines, the rapid improvement
thereof, the various types in use, the duration of
flight, carrying capacity, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Warming to a subject so near to their hearts and
so familiar by constant contact and continuous practice,
the boys alternated in detailing what experience
had taught them about modern aeronautics.
They forgot to feel like a cat in a strange garret,
as at first entrance into the palace. They also forgot
mention that they had, not so long since, flown
over Constantinople in a Russian airship that left a
stream of fire behind it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man on the divan, the only one seated in the
room, during the practical exposition of the past,
present and future of air mastery, had listened attentively
for some twenty minutes or more, when
he indicated by a slight movement of the hand that
the statements already made would suffice.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys backed out through the doorway, held
to that movement by a significant pressure on their
elbows from behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once outside the palace, and putting two and two
together, the young aviators might have guessed
that they had not been very far away from the first
caliph of the Moslem world—the sultan himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys expected that they would be taken back
to where they had left their companions in misfortune,
but this was evidently not the plan of their
guide and custodian. Instead, they proceeded
straight to Golden Horn Harbor, where they
boarded the same steamer that had brought them
up from Marmora.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s ask his nibs what’s on the carpet now,”
suggested Billy, as they stood on the deck of the
vessel then getting under way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Might as well try to open a can of sardines with
a wooden toothpick as to get anything out of that
fellow. But there is no harm in making another attempt,
just to while away the time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>To the surprise of Henri, he missed his guess on
the silent Turk this time. The boys’ reception at
the palace had raised their standing. The officer
told them that they were to repair the damaged aircraft
as soon as it could be done, and then pilot
both war-planes to the capital. Turkey needed all
the aeroplanes it could get, and these had come
cheaply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now let me tell you, Buddy,” confided Henri,
“we are not going to contract to work around these
diggings any longer than we can help; the job
doesn’t appeal to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right you are, pard,” agreed Billy, “we’ve been
pulled and hauled enough; I’d just like to volunteer
to do something on my own account, for a change.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After several days of scientific tinkering, Henri,
ably assisted by his chum, succeeded in reducing the
fracture at the propeller end of the crippled war-plane,
and the machine again worked like a watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What a rattling good chance to steal away in
one of these machines if we could somehow get rid
of the busy watchers ever at our elbows.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a great idea, Henri, but it would be catching
a weasel asleep to dodge that boss Turk who
is charged with our keeping. If there has been a
waking moment for a week that he hasn’t had his
face within arm’s reach of us, I don’t recollect it.
And, Buddy, it has just occurred to me that it
wouldn’t be a very joyful return, after all, pulling
in without the men who rode behind us into this
trap.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a thought that missed me,” regretted
Henri; “we’ll just wait and put something across
that will count us all in.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br />OUT OF THE TOILS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It is doubtful if the chief Turk and the lesser
Moslem who rode with the young aviators from
Marmora to Constantinople had ever before had a
flying experience, but they sat like wooden images
in the observers’ places, impassive and silent. Their
watchword was “kader”—which means that their
fate is in the hands of a superior force, and that
what is going to happen will happen anyway.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the pilots, in a spirit of mischief, put the war-planes
through some fancy paces, they wholly failed
to disturb the composure of the Osmanlis.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Billy remarked later, “the chap with me was
like ‘a painted ship upon a painted ocean,’ and I
couldn’t shake him out of his trance to save my
neck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sailing into the Golden Horn, and alighting on a
quay pointed out by the Turks, the boys found
shelter for the war-planes in a covered bazaar condemned
for military purposes, and located near the
artillery barracks. To the great delight of the lads,
they found Macauley and Canby sitting in front of
the last named building, complacently puffing cheroots
and seemingly with the least worry in the
world.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who comes here?” hailed Canby. “Advance
and say ‘how-de-do.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviators gave the demanded countersign
with a will, and two-handed emphasis.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They have not put us under parole yet, I’m
thankful to say,” stated Macauley in an undertone,
“and I hope they won’t for a week at least. I see
you brought up the war-planes, and, blame me, if I
don’t believe there is some show of a get-away if
we work it right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“S-sh,” warned Canby, “the boss Turk has an
eye on us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The quartette bunked together that night, though
the Turkish officer at first insisted that the boys
should accept quarters to themselves, the honor of
that palace visit still clinging to them. Billy and
Henri very promptly protested against separation
from their comrades, and finally had their way.</p>

<p class='c004'>That they were closely guarded was impressed
by a continuous shuffle of slippered feet throughout
the night before the door of their sleeping apartment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How about your get-away?” whispered Canby.</p>

<p class='c004'>Macauley turned over in his cot, with a grunt.
He was not ready, apparently, with any definite plan
of action.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri were doing some thinking on
their own account. They, too, had yet to realize
upon any brilliant idea of forming.</p>

<p class='c004'>They, however, found in the morning a line of
labor cut out for them, and that was an overhauling
of the Turkish aeroplane stock in the improvised
aerodrome—quite a variety, but rather short in
number and condition, the real quality of the collection
being machines forwarded from Germany.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then it was that Billy expressed a decided liking
for Turkish attire, and he had a reason for that,
with Henri as his sole confidant. The latter, it is
needless to detail, also took immediate notion to a
Moslem masquerade.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy’s next move was to request the assistance, in
the old bazaar structure, of the two British scouts,
for “heavy work,” as he explained it, and the boy
had to hold his sides, so mirth-provoking was the
first appearance of the Britons in Oriental pick-me-ups,
something the worse for former wear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Carrying on in amusement, Billy delivered an address
to the “apprentices,” for the benefit of the real
Turks standing around, in which he advised:
“There is a wise saying I have heard spoken here,
‘Luck is infatuated with the efficient;’ now hustle
and see if luck likes you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Macauley shook a fist at Billy in mock anger,
while Canby made a fearful face at the laughing lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Britons were quick to fathom the design of
the young aviators in getting all of them into disguise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That boy has a good head for music,” was Canby’s
quiet tip to Macauley.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy and Henri certainly earned their salt by the
expert manner in which they set in order the flying
fleet of the Turks, and the Moslem aviators that
went out on scouting trips every day had no complaint
of ill behavior on the part of the aeroplanes
used by them.</p>

<p class='c004'>It might be mentioned that two war-planes of
British make, occupying space near to the open front
of the bazaar building, were not neglected by the
busy aeroplane experts. The tanks of these machines
were kept filled to the brim, and every running
part oiled to a nicety.</p>

<p class='c004'>The prisoners were biding their time, and
awaiting the golden moment when the taskmasters would
relax vigilance by reason of some counter-interest.
Who but their immediate guard could have instant
knowledge that two aeroplanes in the common run
were carrying other than real “defenders of the
faith” on scouting journey?</p>

<p class='c004'>And if all of these intimates in a bunch should
join one of the daily processions to the mosques,
some special occasion demanding it, “just see us
get,” as Billy said when figuring on such a happening.</p>

<p class='c004'>It came about that on a memorable day, nearing
sunset, and the return of the Turkish airmen from
various scouting tours anticipated, the four captives
found themselves alone in the makeshift aerodrome.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Catch on here,” was Billy’s quick summons to
the others, who as quickly responded in rolling out
the war-planes and into the starting place at the
rear of the barracks.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boy pilots set the motors in motion, and never
had the buzzing seemed louder nor more insistent
for attention than on this occasion, when every nerve
in the four human make-ups was taut and tense with
suppressed excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>They are off! Rising above that remarkable
square of At-Meidan, occupying the site of the
ancient Hippodrome, and wheeling to the right of the
magnificent mosque of Soliman, the young aviators
had a clear view of the sea-front.</p>

<p class='c004'>Coming in both directions, up and down the coast,
were the six or eight Turkish aircraft that had set
out from the capital several hours previous.</p>

<p class='c004'>Leaning over Billy’s shoulder, Macauley vociferated
in the young pilot’s ear:</p>

<p class='c004'>“We have a shot in the locker, but none in the
gun.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The “shot in the locker,” to which “Daring Dan”
referred, was food, which from time to time had
been stored in the war-planes, in anticipation of escape
and some unforeseen delay in getting back to
the British lines. The prisoners had had no chance
to obtain any cartridges for the wicked little swiveled
shooting irons carried in the armored aircraft.
The Turkish officer was responsible for the removal
of the original supply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy well knew of the lack mentioned by Macauley,
and he had already decided to dodge the
well-armed airline patrol by turning back from the
sea and making a dash for the open on the Asiatic
side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blame me,” cried Macauley! “it looks like
they’ve got a line on us!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Two of the Turkish craft were coming like the
wind toward the British war-planes, the latter still
working directly upward.</p>

<p class='c004'>That was enough to settle the minds of the pilots
on a land course straightway. Every ounce of driving
power went into the war-plane motors, and there
was nothing aloft in the Turkish empire that had a
ghost of a show in a race with these fleeing space-killers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <br />IN THE GROVES OF DAMASCUS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“They might as well be tied to a post for all the
gain they are making,” gleefully proclaimed Macauley,
looking backward at the pursuing aircraft,
which even then were rapidly fading in the rear distance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I thought I had patched up the junk they
are driving in pretty good shape,” laughingly remarked
Billy, turning his head to see the last of the
winged fleet of the Turks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Canby, in the other war-plane, had just been asking
Henri if he had any idea where he was going.
The pilot strained his voice in telling the soldier
that he “didn’t know,” and at the moment “didn’t
care much.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was strictly the truth, this assertion as to lack
of knowledge of any fixed route to follow, and
equally hazy any idea as to where the war-planes
were going to stop.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the balmy air blowing full in their faces,
and clear sailing under a sun-lit sky, the young
aviators were living in the present—a present
wherein for the first time in many a day the alarms
of war were not resounding. Trouble was behind
them, and very likely in front of them, but sufficient
this little respite.</p>

<p class='c004'>The compass showed that they were traveling in
direction southwest, and far to the left could be
seen a line of railway, on which, reduced by distance,
a toy-sized locomotive was speeding in front
of a miniature train of cars.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the right was unrolled afar a real surface picture
of the ancient land of the nomads—the land
from which come dates, galls, gum, mohair and
carpets, where the camel cushion-foots the deserts
and lies down to rest in the generous shade of the
oasis.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a vast and fertile area over which the warplanes
were sailing, and as their rapid transit carried
the machines further south, the silver threading
of rivers of names unknown to the air travelers
crossed and recrossed the green expanse of the glorious
panorama.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fleas and flies and locusts and plagues do not rise
to aeroplane strata—so it all looked wholly good
then to the aviators.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thirsty and hungry, Billy concluded to chance a
descent, and nearing the ground, saw several muffled
figures hastening away from the stone-bordered
brink of a well, followed by a number of smaller
shapes not muffled at all. Goatskin water pouches
were abandoned and gourd drinking vessels scattered
when the scared water-bearers made their bolt.
They had, perhaps, learned not to shy at a locomotive,
but a buzzing aeroplane suddenly flapping down
from above was a different proposition.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It looks like taking candy from the children,”
said Henri, picking up one of the gourds dropped
by a little bronze cupid, now kiting across a grassy
slope not far from the well.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better drink your fill before some of the tribesmen
come and poke you with a scimitar,” advised
Macauley, who was already setting example.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe they will bother us with these
aeroplanes showing their teeth,” asserted Billy, “and
what’s more, I am going to chance it, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With this declaration, the Bangor boy plumped
himself down on rudely constructed stone settee
alongside the well and contentedly munched some
of the cakes that had been stored against an hour
of hunger in the war-plane lockers.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a land of prophets, Billy was not the least.
The aviation party was not “bothered,” and even
indulged in slumber, without sentinel, for about the
whole night.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The only thing that is of serious outlook,” declared
Billy the next morning, “is just how long the
petrol is going to hold out. We can pick up enough
to eat, at least enough to keep our bones from showing,
but I’ll be blessed if we can run these machines
with anything like olive oil.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are we bound for, anyhow?”—the second
or third time that Canby had put the same question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Ask of the winds that far around with fragments
strewed the sea,’” recited Henri, who had
never forgotten his original attempt to set the “boy
stood on the burning deck” verse to the French language.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘I don’t know where I’m going, but I’m on the
way,’” sang Billy, with a mixture of flat notes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not the only clown in this company, it
seems, Canby,” chuckled Macauley.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Couldn’t aspire with you present,” was Canby’s
retort.</p>

<p class='c004'>The petrol question was not settled by this hilarity,
and as to the destination of the war-planes, only
time could settle that.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There certainly must be some big towns in this
region,” argued Henri, thinking of the railway they
had seen, “and I’ll warrant we can get a tank
supply with the exercise of a little nerve and
diplomacy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is just what you will have to use, and, I
might say, all you have to use to get it,” put in
Billy. “You and I haven’t a red cent between us,
and I doubt if our friends here transferred their
gold and silver to the new, or, rather, old clothes
they are wearing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We didn’t,” exclaimed Macauley, “but I could
tell you to whose clothes the few shillings we carried
were transferred: Abou, peace be with him—not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yet we have Billy’s watch,” advanced Henri,
with a grin; “heirloom though it is, the sacrifice
must be made.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Bangor boy cast a rebuking glance at his
chum, for that battered “turnip” had outworn long-continued
fun-making, as well as any value for exchange
it had ever possessed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that saying, Billy, that you sprung on
us the other day, ‘luck is stuck on the efficient,’ or
something like that? Maybe it will work if you
hustle right on the petrol trail.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Canby was the speaker, and he owed Billy one
for the way the latter had laughed when Macauley
and himself made their début as Turks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Seeing that he was getting the worst of it, Billy
crossed in with:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Too much talk; we’d better be pulling out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no dissent to this, and after Macauley
and Canby had appropriated and filled two of the
goatskin water pouches, the aviation party took to
the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pilots had made up their minds to keep up
a high rate of speed, and take the chances of running
into or near a populous city, where by some
hook or crook the waning supply of petrol could be
replenished.</p>

<p class='c004'>Over 200 miles had been covered that day before
any of the four in the war-planes raised a cry of
“found,” and it was Canby who had the honor of
making the loud announcement:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look, sports; look away to the right!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The vision to which the soldier called attention
were towering domes glittering with the crescent,
rising out of a sea of foliage; white buildings shining
with ivory softness through bordering clumps
of dark verdure, and flat roofs resembling miniature
lakes in the distance.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the war-planes swung around and were sent,
nose on, straight at this point of lovely vista, the
aviators faced breezes laden with the odors of roses
and jasmine.</p>

<p class='c004'>This wilderness of gardens and scented thickets
was encircled by bare mountain walls, piercing the
azure sky above.</p>

<p class='c004'>The war-planes settled in a clearing between two
orchards, and near a bubbling spring, shaded by
olive trees and vines.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let the petrol question go on the table for an
hour or two, anyway,” pleaded Henri, entranced by
the appeal of this earthly paradise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So be it,” agreed Macauley, “and while we are
resting I mean to commune with nature, including
the fruit that yonder tempts me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m with you,” cried Canby, rising from a kneeling
position at the spring, in which he had buried
his face from chin to eyebrow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy, ever practical, turned to the work of gauging
the war-plane tanks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Down to bed-rock, Buddy,” he reported ruefully.
“Twenty-five miles more would finish us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re a regular vandal, pard,” dreamily protested
Henri, backstretched on the grass, his head
pillowed on his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dreamer, however, in the next moment was
sitting up and taking notice, for majestically approaching
from the shady recesses of the nearest
orchard was the grand figure of a man, under turban
and swathed in flowing, loose-sleeved gown, a
veritable patriarch, white-bearded and benign of
countenance.</p>

<p class='c004'>The newcomer, whose eyesight was evidently not
of the best, for he judged the staring lads by their
garb, spoke the familiar greeting in Arabic: “Peace
be with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Drawing nearer, though, and perceiving that the
invaders were of another type than Turk, he astonished
the boys by speaking in perfectly good English.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How came you to Damascus?” was his first
query.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Damascus!” exclaimed Henri. “Is this Damascus?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So; and the oldest city in the world,” gravely
replied the patriarch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where the swords come from!”</p>

<p class='c004'>This from Billy, whose great-grandfather had
handed down a Damascus blade, and which still
hung over the family fireplace back in the Old Bay
state.</p>

<p class='c004'>Macauley and Canby by this time had come up
from the rear, and listening in wonder to the plain
English from the oriental mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man seemed to appreciate that he was
causing a bit of a stir by the fluent use of a foreign
language.</p>

<p class='c004'>Waving his hands, palms upward, he explained:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am one of the Jews who immigrated back
from Europe—and I have memories; oh, so many;
but how long ago; how long ago.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The wisdom of ages was on his brow, and treasured
memories in his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How came you here?” he repeated; “I have listened
and heard no answer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy simply pointed to the war-planes, resting
on the sward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But once have I seen the like, and on high, above
the Mediterranean. Will wonders never cease?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man curiously paced the length of the
machines, and peered through the rigging, lightly
touching the various exposed parts, all the while
talking softly to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally he again directly addressed the aviation
party.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is your will?” he asked, the soul of hospitality
in his eyes. “Food? More than a plenty you
shall have. Shelter? It is yours for the word, but
in these divinely beautiful days, no four walls for
me. Heard ye ever the cry of the desert, and ‘the
house not made with hands’?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So far, so good, kind sir, but have you in the
town any of the stuff generally called ‘petrol’?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The patriarch hesitated at the term of general
classification of fuel oils. “Maybe it is there,” he
replied uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri jumped into the breach by setting forth
that what they wanted was “just oil to burn.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The face of the graybeard flashed a look of comprehension.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is not the impossible that you request; in the
manufactures there is use for the mineral fluid, and
for you it shall be found.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We haven’t the price of it about us,” confessed
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The patriarch shrugged his shoulders. “I am
making no measure of shekels for the stranger at
my door. In my groves take your ease until the
morrow, and all these things I have promised will
be delivered unto you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With these words, spoken like a benediction, the
old man departed in the direction of the splendid
terraces of level roofs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If this isn’t a rum go, count me a goat,” remarked
Canby, in his breezy way, when the four resumed
easy attitude on the green carpet of the glade.
“Young men, you have saved the day, more power
to you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And Billy has saved his watch,” teased Henri,
and for which his chum handed him a rousing slap
on the back.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the coming of the swarthy servitor, whom
Macauley promptly named “Mustapha,” hunger
was routed without benefit of surrender. The platter-bearer
brought a delicious service of cereals,
grapes, figs, oranges and apricots, and coffee as
thick as syrup. To crown it all, for the soldiers,
“Mustapha” also produced some fragrant tobacco,
rolled in husks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think I will register for a month,” enthusiastically
advised Canby; “if this isn’t going on the
sunny side of the street I will never steal another
umbrella.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His comrade, flat on his back, was blowing smoke
rings at the birds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess these are private preserves,” sleepily
commented Billy, “for no other foot has trailed us
but the boss and the black. There is no necessity of
locking up the diamonds and plate to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so the four dreamed in a valley of Lebanon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <br />THROUGH THE HOLY LAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The drumming of a pheasant in a near-by thicket
was the first sound of the dawn to the first of the
four sleepers who emerged from dreamland—no
other than Billy, whose slumber had been haunted
by old impressions of war.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half awake, the boy looked dazedly for the appearance
in the clearing of rank upon rank of
marching soldiers, moving to the measure of the
drum-beat. When, however, he had rubbed his eyes
and realized where he was, his ringing laugh not
only dissolved the fantasy, but brought Henri to his
elbows like a jumping-jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Plague take it,” cried the startled lad; “what
do you mean by scaring a fellow out of his boots?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s just what a jolly old bird over there in
the bushes did to me,” said Billy; “I thought he was
sounding a ‘Charge of the Light Brigade,’ with no
less terrible result than when Bill Williams used to
recite it on exhibition days at Brixton school.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you fellows chattering about?” This
from Canby, rising from his mossy bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Another county heard from,” announced the
Bangor boy; “we were discussing, sir,” he went on,
“whether the clothes you are occupying were tailored
just before or just after the Byzantine period.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold hard there,” put in Macauley; “‘spare
that tree, woodman,’ it’s a fine old oak, no matter
how rough its coat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Canby, beginning to fear that “Mustapha” was
going to be late with the breakfast, broke away
from the wordy exchange to take a look through
the orchard, in the hope of meeting the incoming
provider.</p>

<p class='c004'>He soon returned in triumph, drilling the grinning
black in drum-major style, waving an olive
branch for a baton.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most illustrious purveyor, thou art most doubly
welcome,” declared Macauley, as “Mustapha”
shifted the load from his head to the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>The disappearance of the breakfast marked the
appearance of the patriarch, who was accompanied
by a husky pair of natives, each with a balancing
pole across the shoulders, double-ended with buckets
of brass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of that for which you most wished I have it
here in gallons,” stated the graybeard, “and with
blessing on its use.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy constituted himself a smelling committee of
one to analyze the product in the swinging metal
vessels.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the nearest approach,” decided the young
aviator, “it is either the real thing or first cousin to
it; a little closer to tan-yard aroma than is usual,
perhaps, but the kind that will make the wheels go
’round.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sorrow is with me if this last gift should hasten
the passing of the flying men, for whom I hold a
never-dying welcome.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Touched by the words of the patriarch, and profoundly
grateful for all that he had done for them,
every head among the four was bared, as Macauley,
in his deep voice, and with scarcely concealed emotion,
returned the heartfelt thanks of the aviation
party for the benefactions so freely and so generously
bestowed upon them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That we must soon depart,” he exclaimed, “is
inevitable, but no day to come will be empty of a
thought of our treatment by you. Out in the hurly-burly
we cannot expect to match it, yet out in the
hurly-burly we belong. Peace be with you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On ordinary occasions nothing could have
restrained Canby from crying, “Hear, hear,” at such
eloquence on the part of his usually blunt-spoken
comrade. But Canby had a fine edge under his
rough and ready manner, and he merely nodded his
head in approval of the sentiment expressed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are a soldier?” The aged man had evident
intent of changing the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two of us are in the service, sir,” replied Macauley,
“and would answer the bugle call did we
but know where it was sounding hereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The patriarch raised his dimming eyes to the blue
canopy above, a prayer on his lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That all could say, ‘peace be with you,’” he muttered.
Then, drawing himself up in the full measure
of his tall figure, the old man, with a sweeping
gesture to the south, quietly directed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“That way does the carnage rage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He gave more minutely, however, details of distance,
territory to be traversed and other facts of
value to the travelers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We will start in the morning, sir,” advised Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And so it is written,” solemnly returned the
patriarch. “Farewell and fare thee well.” To the
boy he handed a scroll, with Arabic characters
thereon. “To any Jew,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gathering his robe about him, the speaker turned
into the shady walk of the orchard, followed by his
dusky retainers.</p>

<p class='c004'>More of his bounty came during the day, but
never another sign of his presence in the hours that
completed the stay of the flyers on the border of the
city that its people call “a pearl set in emeralds.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Following the southerly course, as directed, the
aviators began to note a change in the fleeting landscape
below, nature in less luxuriant form, foliage
sparse and more and more of the stony gray of arid
country with wide wastes of desert sand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Macauley’s loud cry—“the sea, the sea!” found
an echo in the other war-plane, Canby also shouting
his discovery of the great expanse of water to
the west.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henri, remembering the advices of the patriarch
at Damascus, proclaimed it the Mediterranean. The
war-planes were sailing over the deep valley of the
Jordan, and in Palestine, or the Holy Land.</p>

<p class='c004'>With so much mountainous country about them,
the pilots concluded to descend to the valley for rest
and council.</p>

<p class='c004'>Landing was made near a spring of boiling hot
water, something not before of record in Henri’s
notebook.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If the janitor of my uncle’s apartment house in
Boston had this to tap for the kicking tenants, I
believe the hump in his shoulders would lose its
curve in a week.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy had tested the product of the boiling spring
with a finger tip, and promptly poked the scalded
member into his mouth for cooling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It wouldn’t be a marker to the way my Aunt
Melissa would go on,” remarked Canby, “if she
knew her wayward nephew was really in the ‘land
flowing in milk and honey.’ Even if the ‘flow’ isn’t
showing much yet to me, that good old soul has it
fixed in her mind. It wasn’t so far from here, I
guess, that King David looked one way at Philistine
enemies and the other at Moabite foes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suppose we may as well camp here for the
night,” said Henri, “though it strikes me that I’d
rather be where the sea would sing me to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No dark night flying for me this trip. I don’t
want to smash any mountains by running into
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy had concluded that the sand was soft enough
for a good bed, and there was another spring near,
in decided contrast to the hot one.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can be in Jerusalem in almost no time now,
and a little further on the fighting game begins
again. Why hurry? There’ll be plenty of powder
left when we get to Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You ought to have said that before we shook
the pleasant berth up at Damascus, Billy,” insisted
Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, you know, Macauley and Canby wouldn’t
have consented to keeping that far away from the
cannon’s mouth. They know now that the jumping-off
place is close enough to reach in a day or
two, and, maybe, they’ll stand hitched for a little
while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy spoke loud enough for the soldiers to hear,
as he intended.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t worry yourself, my kiddy,” laughed
Canby; “we are not going to run away from you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s a big bunch of sheep and goats, I see,
feeding around these hills, but strange to say, we
haven’t glimpsed a single human since we came
down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This observation by Macauley conveyed a fact
at which the others, too, had wondered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” asserted Billy, “there’s one thing sure,
we had more of an air escort flying in here than
I’ve seen in many a long ride. The eagles, vultures
and hawks must think the war-planes are a new
brand of bird come to crowd them out of business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe they thought the planes were geese, seeing
Canby’s head sticking out of the rigging.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mac’s jealous,” parried Canby; “he has to keep
his ears folded up when we’re flying, and can only
bray on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why don’t you fellows put on the gloves?” suggested
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess they don’t irrigate this country like they
used to do in the old days,” observed Henri, who
had been taking a little jaunt of inspection toward
the overhanging hills; “it’s as dry as a bone, and if
you show me a tree I’ll eat it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’d better save your appetite for the spread
we are going to have before we turn in,” said Billy;
“our old friend at Damascus sure gave us a load of
fig-pasty fixings that we’ll have to get away with
before they spoil. And, besides, Buddy, this is a
tiny little country, they say, and we may see a better
side of it when we go a bit further.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That will be at daylight, I hope,” put in Macauley.</p>

<p class='c004'>When next the sun rose above the plateaux, the
war-planes had lifted for flight to the great maritime
plain at the west of the Jordan, a wonderful
journey, over a country of stones, caves, tombs,
ruins, battlefields, sites hallowed by traditions—all
bathed in an atmosphere of legend and marvel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Drawing near now to Jerusalem, “The Holy,”
one of the most ancient and interesting cities in the
world, the aviators from afar could see its walls
outlined three thousand feet above the sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>Approaching this center of pilgrimage in an
aeroplane! Dashing toward the “wall of David”
in a buzz-boat of the air! “Something to remember,”
thought Billy, steering for one of the five city
gates now in use.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the war-planes skidded in the train of a
procession of mules and camels, there was considerable
of a scare along the line, and the aviators
were soon surrounded by a curious bunch of
Bedouins. It was just a babel to the airmen, until
there stepped from the press of strange humanity
one of authoritative manner, a Hebrew of advanced
age and apparent consequence.</p>

<p class='c004'>It struck the travelers all in a heap, the marked
similarity of type between the Jew of Damascus
and the man who stood before them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter intently surveyed both the flying machines
and flyers before he spoke, and in English,
for he saw that the four were but poor imitations
of Turks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Came you this way or that?” he questioned,
pointing in turn to the flanking valleys at all points
of the compass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“From the north,” promptly replied Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>It just then occurred to the boy to produce the
scroll given to him by the Damascus patriarch. “To
any Jew,” the latter had said, and here was a goodly
specimen of the race within easy reach.</p>

<p class='c004'>So Billy stepped forward with the parchment roll
in extended hand. A brief glance at the Arabic
communication by the man accepting it had magic
effect.</p>

<p class='c004'>He clapped his hands in signal to someone in the
confusedly murmuring crowd, and two Arabs, mere
boys, responded, leading a pair of heavily laden donkeys.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few words of command and the loads on the
donkeys’ backs were transferred to the humps of
two camels, the last named animals making protest
by savage teeth snaps at the nimble servitors
doing the work.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rope attachments made, the war-planes were
hauled through the city gate, the first and only time
these machines ever worked under donkey power!</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning out of the traffic of the main road into
a narrow, ill-paved street, down-sloping into the
interior of the city, the four flyers, walking alongside
of the machines to steady them, and their self-declared
host marching ahead of the donkey drivers,
passed through long double lines of dead walls, for
though the houses were substantially built of stone
they presented no windows to the streets.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, the air travelers had a glimpse or two
of the modern Jerusalem here and there; new hotels,
for instance, that had the appearance of being up-to-date.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No look-in there for us,” sighed Billy; “we’re
just plain broke; but let me say, Buddy, it seems
that we are somehow always provided for, no matter
what has happened on this side of the ocean.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Giving the glad hand seems a specialty with the
Damascus man and his twin in Jerusalem; they’re
all to the good in that line,” declared Henri.</p>

<p class='c004'>Canby would have strayed from the line of march
when he caught sight in the distance of the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre, but the leader kept straight
ahead, and the Arab boys were constantly whanging
the donkeys to keep up with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Pausing finally in front of a flat-roofed stone
dwelling, with courtyard enclosure, the war-planes
were sheltered within the walls of the latter, while
the host guided his guests into and through the
house to an extensive garden at the rear, rich with
flowering plants.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably our last day of peaceful avocation,”
mused Canby, as he applied a lighted taper to the
bowl of a long-stemmed pipe, which had been served
to him by an Arab attendant.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXX.' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <br />OFF FOR EGYPT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“The reverend sir tells me that this country of
Palestine is only 140 miles long and about 80 miles
wide,” said Henri, who had entered the information
in his ragged notebook, to which he had clung
like grim death from the day he had entered the
war zone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My Aunt Melissa would tell you,” stated Canby,
“that nearly all the events in the accounts of Israel
that are recorded in the Old Testament happened
within this space. From the days of Abraham to
our own times there’s been a mighty lot of history
made here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pity we could not have gone about a little bit
more,” remarked Billy, “but warriors and war-planes
must get to the front.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it pleases your honor,” slyly intimated Macauley,
“Canby and I could walk the rest of the
way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got a picture of you doing it,” retorted the
Bangor boy; “the war would be over by the time
you got anywhere. You were built for riding, my
bold captain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Listen to the wasp,” laughed Canby.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stillness of evening pervaded the garden, and
the four fell into the brooding silence of the hour.
The liquid notes of a nightingale contributed to the
dreamy effect of the oriental surroundings. With
the morning the vision of the Holy Land would
fade.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up betimes, again alert and eager to proceed, the
air travelers had once more the kindly greeting of
the venerable host, and once more partook of his
generous hospitality. At his order the war-planes
were wheeled into the open, and followed by a blessing
the pilots, fully advised of the route, sent the
machines buzzing away to the south, along the
Mediterranean coast line.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their fixed destination was El Arish, on the border
of Palestine and Egypt, the key to the fighting
zone in the land of Suez and the Nile, where General
Maxwell, in command of the British forces,
was matching wits with the Ottoman commanders,
urged to best effort by the presence of Enver Pasha,
the young “war lord” of Turkey.</p>

<p class='c004'>While fully ten miles away from the border,
Macauley declared that he could scent gunpowder, and
as the distance rapidly lessened, numerous enough
were the signs of military occupation to convince
Billy that the soldier’s nose had not gone back on
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>A half hour later the war-planes were down, and
Macauley and Canby had found their own again;
if not, indeed, the “old Seventh,” just the same
kind of fighting blood under the Union Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>While Billy and Henri got busy in overhauling
the war-planes and reducing in the machines some
of the effects of rough usage and continuous journeying,
the two soldiers were equally active in getting
into the campaign. Well set up again in khaki
uniforms and with pith helmets on their heads,
“Daring Dan” and Canby looked like ten-time winners.
The boys also had ceased to be “Turks,” by
the courtesy of the quartermaster.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess we’ll have to shake you for a while, and
sorry for it, my young friends. We have your
gauge for a dandy pair, and the breed to which anyone
may safely tie; so I am just wanting to say that
I hope we will meet many times and often in the
future, the nearer the better.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the occasion?” questioned Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Marching orders for the morning,” continued
Macauley; “not a flying assignment this time, or
you boys would be on the front seats. Just plain
footing it for the present.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The speaker gave each of the boys a hearty grip
and a look of strong liking, Canby following suit
with equal fervor.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the soldiers turned away to join the regiment
to which they had been assigned, the lads
climbed to an elevation on the sea front and looked
out upon the rolling blue of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Many the hard parting we’ve had, Buddy,” murmured
Billy; “how I would love to go back over
the trail and greet the good friends and true comrades
again, one by one. Mayhap some of the warm
hands are cold by now, some of the great hearts
stilled. My prayer is that this be not so. And I’ve
been asking myself if there is any pledge behind us
that we have broken?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe there’s a single shortage there,”
exclaimed Henri—“why, yes, there is, too, come to
think twice—Stanny’s belt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not so much of a fracture there, after all,” said
the Bangor boy—“only delayed delivery. We
couldn’t help that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s call the past a fairly clean slate, then,”
conceded Henri. “Faces to the front, old pard;
we’re not through yet!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boy was right; there were still strenuous days
in the mist-veiled future, and in territory all unknown
to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>A message to Port Said was in the making, and
no wires to convey it; what next to the electric flash
for lightning speed? The aeroplane!</p>

<p class='c004'>The call was sudden, but no less prompt the response.</p>

<p class='c004'>Billy Barry and Henri Trouville saluted a pair of
shoulder straps, received the word to go—and,
forthwith, went!</p>

<p class='c004'>Their flight carries them into the continuing record
of adventure: “Our Young Aeroplane Scouts
in Turkey; or, Bringing the Light to Yusef.”</p>

    <div><span class='xlarge'>The Boy Chums Series</span></div>
    <div class='c000'>By WILMER M. ELY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In this series of remarkable stories by Wilmer M.
Ely are described the adventures of two boy chums—Charley
West and Walter Hazard—in the great swamps
of interior Florida and among the cays off the Florida
Coast, and through the Bahama Islands. These are real,
live boys, and their experiences are well worth following.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>THE BOY CHUMS ON INDIAN RIVER; or, The Boy Partners of the Schooner “Orphan.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In this story Charley West and Walter Hazard meet deadly rattlesnakes; have
a battle with a wild panther; are attacked by outlaws: their boat is towed by a
swordfish; they are shipwrecked by a monster manatee fish, and pass safely
through many exciting scenes of danger. This book should be read first.</p>

<p class='c007'>THE BOY CHUMS ON HAUNTED ISLAND; or, Hunting for Pearls in the Bahama Islands.</p>

<p class='c011'>This book tells the story of the boy chums’ adventures on the schooner “Eager
Quest,” hunting for pearls among the Bahama Islands. Their hairbreadth escapes
from the treacherous quicksands and dangerous waterspouts, and their rescue
from the wicked wreckers are fully told.</p>

<p class='c007'>THE BOY CHUMS IN THE FOREST; or, Hunting for Plume Birds in the Florida Everglades.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story of the boy chums hunting the blue herons and the pink and white
egrets for their plumes in the forests of Florida is full of danger and excitement.
In this story is fully told how the chums encountered the Indians; their battles
with the escaped convicts; their fight with the wild boars and alligators; and
many exciting encounters and escapes. This is the third story of the boy chums’
adventures.</p>

<p class='c007'>THE BOY CHUMS’ PERILOUS CRUISE; or, Searching for Wreckage on the Florida Coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>This story of the boy chums’ adventures on and off the Florida Coast describes
many scenes of daring and adventure, in hunting for ships stranded and cargoes
washed ashore. The boy chums passed through many exciting scenes, their
conflicts with the Cuban wreckers; the loss of their vessel, the “Eager Quest,”
they will long remember. This is the fourth book of adventures which the boy
chums experienced.</p>

<p class='c007'>THE BOY CHUMS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO; or, a Dangerous Cruise with the Greek Spongers.</p>

<p class='c011'>This story of the boy chums hunting for sponges is filled with many adventures.
The dangers of gathering sponges are fully described; the chums meet with
sharks and alligators: and they are cast away on a desert island. Their rescue
and arrival home make a most interesting story. This is the fifth book of adventures
of the boy chums.</p>

<p class='c007'>THE BOY CHUMS CRUISING IN FLORIDA WATERS; or, the Perils and Dangers of the Fishing Fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this story Charley West and Walter Hazard embark upon a new and
dangerous quest for fortune. With their old and tried comrades, Captain Westfield
and the little negro, Chris, they join the great army of fishermen that
yearly search the Florida seas for the thousands of kinds of rare fish and water
creatures that abound there. The Florida waters hide many strange and unknown
dangers. The perils the chums encounter from weird fishes and creatures
of the sea and the menace of hurricane and shipwreck, make very interesting
and instructive reading. This is the sixth book of adventures of the boy chums.</p>
